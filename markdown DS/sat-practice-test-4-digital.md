The following text is adapted from Susan Glaspell's 1912 short story "Out There." An elderly shop owner is looking at a picture that he recently acquired and hopes to sell.

It did seem that the picture failed to fit in with the rest of the shop. A persuasive young fellow who claimed he was closing out his stock let the old man have it for what he called a song. It was only a little out-of-the-way store which subsisted chiefly on the framing of pictures. The old man looked around at his views of the city, his pictures of cats and dogs, his flaming bits of landscape. "Don't belong in here," he fumed.

And yet the old man was secretly proud of his acquisition. There was a hidden dignity in his scowling as he shuffled about pondering the least ridiculous place for the picture.

## Text 1

Conventional wisdom long held that human social systems evolved in stages, beginning with hunter-gatherers forming small bands of members with roughly equal status. The shift to agriculture about 12,000 years ago sparked population growth that led to the emergence of groups with hierarchical structures: associations of clans first, then chiefdoms, and finally, bureaucratic states.

## Text 2

In a 2021 book, anthropologist David Graeber and archaeologist David Wengrow maintain that humans have always been socially flexible, alternately forming systems based on hierarchy and collective ones with decentralized leadership. The authors point to evidence that as far back as 50,000 years ago some hunter-gatherers adjusted their social structures seasonally, at times dispersing in small groups but also assembling into communities that included esteemed individuals.

Based on the texts, how would Graeber and Wengrow (Text 2) most likely respond to the "conventional wisdom" presented in Text 1?
A) By conceding the importance of hierarchical systems but asserting the greater significance of decentralized collective societies
B) By disputing the idea that developments in social structures have followed a linear progression through distinct stages
C) By acknowledging that hierarchical roles likely weren't a part of social systems before the rise of agriculture
D) By challenging the assumption that groupings of hunter-gatherers were among the earliest forms of social structure

The following text is adapted from Frances Hodgson Burnett's 1911 novel The Secret Garden. Mary, a young girl, recently found an overgrown hidden garden.

Mary was an odd, determined little person, and now she had something interesting to be determined about, she was very much absorbed, indeed. She worked and dug and pulled up weeds steadily, only becoming more pleased with her work every hour instead of tiring of it. It seemed to her like a fascinating sort of play.

Which choice best states the main idea of the text?
A) Mary hides in the garden to avoid doing her chores.
B) Mary is getting bored with pulling up so many weeds in the garden.
C) Mary is clearing out the garden to create a space to play.

The following text is from Ezra Pound's 1909 poem "Hymn III," based on the work of Marcantonio Flaminio.

As a fragile and lovely flower unfolds its gleaming foliage on the breast of the fostering earth, if the dew and the rain draw it forth;
So doth my tender mind flourish, if it be fed with the sweet dew of the fostering spirit,
Lacking this, it beginneth straightway to languish, even as a floweret born upon dry earth, if the dew and the rain tend it not.

Thornton alone held [Buck]. The rest of mankind was as nothing. Chance travellers might praise or pet him; but he was cold under it all, and from a too demonstrative man he would get up and walk away. When Thornton's partners, Hans and Pete, arrived on the long-expected raft, Buck refused to notice them till he learned they were close to Thornton; after that he tolerated them in a passive sort of way, accepting favors from them as though he favored them by accepting.

Which choice best states the main idea of the text?

Biologist Valentina Gómez-Bahamón and her team have investigated two subspecies of the fork-tailed flycatcher bird that live in the same region in Colombia, but one subspecies migrates south for part of the year, and the other doesn't. The researchers found that, due to slight differences in feather shape, the feathers of migratory forked-tailed flycatcher males make a sound during flight that is higher pitched than that made by the feathers of nonmigratory males. The researchers hypothesize that fork-tailed flycatcher females are attracted to the specific sound made by the males of their own subspecies, and that over time the females' preference will drive further genetic and anatomical divergence between the subspecies.

Which finding, if true, would most directly support Gómez-Bahamón and her team's hypothesis?
A) The feathers located on the wings of the migratory fork-tailed flycatchers have a narrower shape than those of the nonmigratory birds, which allows them to fly long distances.
B) Over several generations, the sound made by the feathers of migratory male fork-tailed flycatchers grows progressively higher pitched relative to that made by the feathers of nonmigratory males.
C) Fork-tailed flycatchers communicate different messages to each other depending on whether their feathers create high-pitched or low-pitched sounds.
D) The breeding habits of the migratory and nonmigratory fork-tailed flycatchers remained generally the same over several generations.

Ablation Rates for Three Elements in Cosmic Dust, by Dust Source

| Element | SPC | AST | HTC | OCC |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| iron | $20 \%$ | $28 \%$ | $90 \%$ | $98 \%$ |
| potassium | $44 \%$ | $74 \%$ | $97 \%$ | $100 \%$ |
| sodium | $45 \%$ | $75 \%$ | $99 \%$ | $100 \%$ |

Earth's atmosphere is bombarded by cosmic dust originating from several sources: short-period comets (SPCs), particles from the asteroid belt (ASTs), Halley-type comets (HTCs), and Oort cloud comets (OCCs). Some of the dust's material vaporizes in the atmosphere in a process called ablation, and the faster the particles move, the higher the rate of ablation. Astrophysicist Juan Diego Carrillo-Sánchez led a team that calculated average ablation rates for elements in the dust (such as iron and potassium) and showed that material in slowermoving SPC or AST dust has a lower rate than the same material in faster-moving HTC or OCC dust. For example, whereas the average ablation rate for iron from AST dust is $28 \%$, the average rate for $\qquad$
Which choice most effectively uses data from the table to complete the example?
A) iron from SPC dust is $20 \%$.
B) sodium from OCC dust is $100 \%$.
C) iron from HTC dust is $90 \%$.
D) sodium from AST dust is $75 \%$.

Art collectives, like the United States- and Vietnambased collective The Propeller Group or Cuba's Los Carpinteros, are groups of artists who agree to work together: perhaps for stylistic reasons, or to advance certain shared political ideals, or to help mitigate the costs of supplies and studio space. Regardless of the reasons, art collectives usually involve some collaboration among the artists. Based on a recent series of interviews with various art collectives, an arts journalist claims that this can be difficult for artists who are often used to having sole control over their work.

Which quotation from the interviews best illustrates the journalist's claim?
A) "The first collective I joined included many amazingly talented artists, and we enjoyed each other's company, but because we had a hard time sharing credit and responsibility for our work, the collective didn't last."
B) "We work together, but that doesn't mean that individual projects are equally the work of all of us. Many of our projects are primarily the responsibility of whoever originally proposed the work to the group."
C) "Having worked as a member of a collective for several years, it's sometimes hard to recall what it was like to work alone without the collective's support. But that support encourages my individual expression rather than limits it."
D) "Sometimes an artist from outside the collective will choose to collaborate with us on a project, but all of those projects fit within the larger themes of the work the collective does on its own."

Cats can judge unseen people's positions in space by the sound of their voices and thus react with surprise when the same person calls to them from two different locations in a short span of time. Saho Takagi and colleagues reached this conclusion by measuring cats' levels of surprise based on their ear and head movements while the cats heard recordings of their owners' voices from two speakers spaced far apart. Cats exhibited a low level of surprise when owners' voices were played twice from the same speaker, but they showed a high level of surprise when the voice was played once each from the two different speakers.

According to the text, how did the researchers determine the level of surprise displayed by the cats in the study?
A) They watched how each cat moved its ears and head.
B) They examined how each cat reacted to the voice of a stranger.
C) They studied how each cat physically interacted with its owner.
D) They tracked how each cat moved around the room.

A student performs an experiment testing her hypothesis that a slightly acidic soil environment is more beneficial for the growth of the plant Brassica rapa parachinensis (a vegetable commonly known as choy sum) than a neutral soil environment. She plants sixteen seeds of choy sum in a mixture of equal amounts of coffee grounds (which are highly acidic) and potting soil and another sixteen seeds in potting soil without coffee grounds as the control for the experiment.

"The Young Girl" is a 1920 short story by Katherine Mansfield. In the story, the narrator takes an unnamed seventeen-year-old girl and her younger brother out for a meal. In describing the teenager, Mansfield frequently contrasts the character's pleasant appearance with her unpleasant attitude, as when Mansfield writes of the teenager, $\qquad$
Which quotation from "The Young Girl" most effectively illustrates the claim?
A) "I heard her murmur, 'I can't bear flowers on a table.' They had evidently been giving her intense pain, for she positively closed her eyes as I moved them away."
B) "While we waited she took out a little, gold powder-box with a mirror in the lid, shook the poor little puff as though she loathed it, and dabbed her lovely nose."
C) "I saw, after that, she couldn't stand this place a moment longer, and, indeed, she jumped up and turned away while I went through the vulgar act of paying for the tea."
D) "She didn't even take her gloves off. She lowered her eyes and drummed on the table. When a faint violin sounded she winced and bit her lip again. Silence."

High levels of public uncertainty about which economic policies a country will adopt can make planning difficult for businesses, but measures of such uncertainty have not tended to be very detailed. Recently, however, economist Sandile Hlatshwayo analyzed trends in news reports to derive measures not only for general economic policy uncertainty but also for uncertainty related to specific areas of economic policy, like tax or trade policy. One revelation of her work is that a general measure may not fully reflect uncertainty about specific areas of policy, as in the case of the United Kingdom, where general economic policy uncertainty $\qquad$

Which choice most effectively uses data from the graph to illustrate the claim?
A) aligned closely with uncertainty about tax and public spending policy in 2005 but differed from uncertainty about tax and public spending policy by a large amount in 2009.
B) was substantially lower than uncertainty about tax and public spending policy each year from 2005 to 2010.
C) reached its highest level between 2005 and 2010 in the same year that uncertainty about trade policy and tax and public spending policy reached their lowest levels.
D) was substantially lower than uncertainty about trade policy in 2005 and substantially higher than uncertainty about trade policy in 2010.

Linguist Deborah Tannen has cautioned against framing contentious issues in terms of two highly competitive perspectives, such as pro versus con. According to Tannen, this debate-driven approach can strip issues of their complexity and, when used in front of an audience, can be less informative than the presentation of multiple perspectives in a noncompetitive format. To test Tannen's hypothesis, students conducted a study in which they showed participants one of three different versions of local news commentary about the same issue. Each version featured a debate between two commentators with opposing views, a panel of three commentators with various views, or a single commentator.

Which finding from the students' study, if true, would most strongly support Tannen's hypothesis?
A) On average, participants perceived commentators in the debate as more knowledgeable about the issue than commentators in the panel.
B) On average, participants perceived commentators in the panel as more knowledgeable about the issue than the single commentator.
C) On average, participants who watched the panel correctly answered more questions about the issue than those who watched the debate or the single commentator did.
D) On average, participants who watched the single commentator correctly answered more questions about the issue than those who watched the debate did.

Many of William Shakespeare's tragedies address broad themes that still appeal to today's audiences. For instance, Romeo and Juliet, which is set in the Italy of Shakespeare's time, tackles the themes of parents versus children and love versus hate, and the play continues to be read and produced widely around the world. But understanding Shakespeare's so-called history plays can require a knowledge of several centuries of English history. Consequently, $\qquad$

D) experts in English history tend to prefer Shakespeare's history plays to his other works.

Ancestral Puebloans, the civilization from which present-day Pueblo tribes descended, emerged as early as 1500 B.C.E. in an area of what is now the southwestern United States and dispersed suddenly in the late 1200s C.E., abandoning established villages with systems for farming crops and turkeys. Recent analysis comparing turkey remains at Mesa Verde, one such village in southern Colorado, to samples from modern turkey populations in the Rio Grande Valley of north central New Mexico determined that the latter birds descended in part from turkeys cultivated at Mesa Verde, with shared genetic markers appearing only after 1280. Thus, researchers concluded that $\qquad$

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:

- The calendar used by most of the world (the Gregorian calendar) has 365 days.
- Because 365 days can't be divided evenly by 7 (the number of days in a week), calendar dates fall on a different day of the week each year.
- The Hanke-Henry permanent calendar, developed as an alternative to the Gregorian calendar, has 364 days.
- Because 364 can be divided evenly by 7 , calendar dates fall on the same day of the week each year, which supports more predictable scheduling.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:

- In 1999, astronomer Todd Henry studied the differences in surface temperature between the Sun and nearby stars.
- His team mapped all stars within 10 parsecs (approximately 200 trillion miles) of the Sun.
- The surface temperature of the Sun is around $9,800^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, which classifies it as a G star.
- 327 of the 357 stars in the study were classified as K or M stars, with surface temperatures under $8,900^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ (cooler than the Sun).
- 11 of the 357 stars in the study were classified as A or F stars, with surface temperatures greater than $10,300^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ (hotter than the Sun).

The student wants to emphasize how hot the Sun is relative to nearby stars. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?
A) At around $9,800^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, which classifies it as a G star, the Sun is hotter than most but not all of the stars within 10 parsecs of it.
B) Astronomer Todd Henry determined that the Sun, at around $9,800^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, is a G star, and several other stars within a 10 -parsec range are A or F stars.
C) Of the 357 stars within ten parsecs of the Sun, 327 are classified as K or M stars, with surface temperatures under $8,900^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$.
D) While most of the stars within 10 parsecs of the Sun are classified as K, M, A, or F stars, the Sun is classified as a G star due to its surface temperature of $9,800^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:

- The magnificent frigatebird (fregata magnificens) is a species of seabird that feeds mainly on fish, tuna, squid, and other small sea animals.
- It is unusual among seabirds in that it doesn't dive into the water for prey.
- One way it acquires food is by using its hook-tipped bill to snatch prey from the surface of the water.
- Another way it acquires food is by taking it from weaker birds by force.
- This behavior is known as kleptoparasitism.
