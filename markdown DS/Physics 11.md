Physics is the most fundamental branch of physical sciences. It provides the basic principles and laws which help to understand the mysteries of other branches of sciences such as astronomy, chemistry, geology, biology and health sciences. The tools, techniques and products of Physics have transformed our dreams into realities. The comforts and pleasures added in our lives are fruitful results of science, technology and engineering in everyday life.
The information technology has entirely changed the outlook of mankind. The fast means of communication have brought people of the entire world in so close contact that the whole world has become a global village.

Computer chips are made from silicon, which is obtained from sand. It is up to us whether we make a sand castle or a computer out of it.

Physics is an experimental science and the scientific method emphasizes the need of accurate measurement of various measurable physical quantities. This chapter stresses in understanding the concept of measuring techniques and recording skills.

# 1.1 PHYSICAL QUANTITIESAND THEIR UNITS 

The foundation of physics depends on physical quantities in terms of which the laws of Physics are expressed. Therefore, these quantities have to be measured accurately. These are mass, length, time, velocity, force, density, temperature, electric current, and numerous others.
Physical quantities are often divided into two categories: base quantities and derived quantities. Derived quantities are those which depend on base quantities. Examples of derived quantities are velocity, acceleration, force, etc. Base quantities are not defined in terms of other physical quantities. The base quantities are the independent physical quantities in terms of which the other physical quantities can be defined. Typical examples of base quantities are length, mass and time.
The measurement of a base quantity involves two steps: first, the choice of a standard, and second, the establishment of a procedure for comparing the quantity to be measured with the standard so that a number and a unit are determined as the measure of that quantity.
Measurements must be reliable and accurate so that they can be used, easily and effectively.

### 1.2 INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM OF UNITS

In 1960, an international committee agreed on a set of definitions and standards to describe the physical quantities. The system that was established is called the System International (SI).
SI units are used by the world's scientific community and by almost all nations. The system International (SI) consists of two kinds of units: base units and derived units.

## Base Units

There are seven base units for physical quantities namely: length, mass, time, temperature, electric current, light or luminous intensity and amount of substance (with special reference to the number of particles). Prefixes such as milli, micro, kilo, etc. may be used with them to express smaller or larger quantities.

Table 1.1

| Physical <br> Quantity | SI Unit | Symbol |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Length | mste | m |
| Mass | kilogram | kg |
| Time | second | s |
| Electric <br> current | ampere | A |
| Thermodynamic <br> temperature | kelvin | K |
| Intensity of <br> light | candela | cd |
| Amount of <br> substance | mole | mol |

The names of base units for these physical quantities together with symbols are listed in Table 1.1.

# Derived Units 

Derived units are those units which depend on the base units. Some of the derived units are given in Table. 1.2. The units of plane angle and solid angle have also been included in the list of derived units since 1995.
In addition to base and derived units, the SI permits the use of certain additional units, including:

| Table 1.2 |  |  |  |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Physical quantity | Unit | Symbol | In terms of base units |
| Plane angle | radian | rad | dimensionless |
| Solid angle | steradian | sr | dimensionless |
| Force | newton | N | $\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{m} \mathrm{s}^{-2}$ |
| Work | joule | J | $\mathrm{Nm}=\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}$ |
| Power | watt | W | $\mathrm{J} \mathrm{s}^{-1}=\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}$ |
| Electric charge | coulomb | C | As |
| Pressure | pascal | Pa | $\mathrm{Nm}^{-2}=\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{m}^{-1} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}$ |

- The traditional mathematical units for measuring angles (degree, arcminute, and arcsecond).
- The traditional units for standard time are (minute, hour, day, and year).
- The logarithmic units bel (and its multiples, such as the decibel).
- Two metric units commonly used in ordinary life: the litre for volume and the tonne (metric ton) for large masses.
- Two non-metric scientific units are atomic mass unit ( $\mu$ ) and the electron volt (eV).
- The nautical mile and knot; units traditionally used at sea and in meteorology.
- The acre and hectare, common metric units of land area.
- The bar is a unit of pressure and it is commonly used as the millibar in meteorology and the kilobar in engineering.
- The angstrom and the bam, units used in physics and astronomy.


## Scientific Notation

Numbers are expressed in standard form called scientific notation, which employs powers of ten. The internationally accepted practice is that there should be only one non-zero digit left of decimal. Thus, the number 134.7 should be written as $1.347 \times 10^{2}$ and 0.0023 be expressed as $2.3 \times 10^{-3}$.
[Image removed]

# Prefixes 

Most prefixes indicate order of magnitude in steps of 1000 and provide a convenient way to express large and small numbers, to eliminate non-significant digits. SI also includes four of the other prefixes to accommodate usage already established before the introduction of SI (Table 1.3). They are centi- $\left(10^{-3}\right)$, deci- $\left(10^{-4}\right)$, deca- $\left(10^{1}\right)$ and hecto- $\left(10^{2}\right)$.

## Conventions for Using SI Units

Use of SI units requires special care, more particularly in writing prefixes. Some points to note are:

1. Each SI unit is represented by a symbol not an abbreviation. These symbols are the same in all languages. Hence, correct use of the symbol is very important.
For example: For ampere, we should use "A" not "amp"; for seconds, "s" not "sec", SI not S.I.
2. Full name of unit does not begin with capital letter. For example: newton, metre, etc., except Celsius.
3. Symbols appear in lower case.

For example: "m" for metre, "s" for second, etc., exception "L" for litre.
4. Symbols named after scientists have initial letters capital.
For example: "N" for newton, "Pa" for pascal, "W" for watt.
5. Symbols and prefixes are printed in upright (roman) style regardless of the type style in surrounding text.
For example: a distance of 50 m .
6. Symbols do not take plural form.

For example: $1 \mathrm{~mm}, 100 \mathrm{~mm}, 1 \mathrm{~kg}, 60 \mathrm{~kg}$.
7. No fullstop or dot is placed after the symbol except at the end of the sentence.
8. Prefix is written before and without space to base unit. For example: "mL" not mL or "ms" not m s.
9. Base units are written one space apart. Leave a space even between the number (value) and the symbol. For example: $1 \mathrm{~kg}, 10 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$, etc.

Approximate Values of Some Time Intervals

## Do you know?

Mass can be thought of as a form of energy. In effect, the mass is highly concentrated form of energy. Einstein's famous equation, Ennac ${ }^{2}$ means:

Energy $=$ mass $x$ (speed of light) ${ }^{2}$
According to this equation 1 kg mass is actually $9 \times 10^{10} \mathrm{~J}$ of energy.

10. Compound prefixes are not allowed:

For example: $1 \mu \mu \mathrm{~F}$ should be 1 pF .
11. When base unit of multiple is raised to a power, the power applies to whole multiple and not to base unit alone.
For example: $1 \mathrm{~km}^{2}=1(\mathrm{~km})^{2}=1 \times\left(10^{3} \mathrm{~m}\right)^{2}=1 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~m}^{2}$.
12. Use negative index notation ( $\mathrm{ms}^{-1}$ ) instead of solidus ( $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$ ).
13. Use scientific notation, that is, one non-zero digit left of decimal.

For example: $143.7=1.437 \times 10^{2}$.
14. Do not mix symbols and names in the same expression.

For example: metre per second or $\mathrm{ms}^{-1}$, notmetre/sec or $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{sec}$ ond.
15. Practical work should be recorded in most convenient units depending upon the instruments being used.
For Example: Measurements using screw gauge should be recorded in mm but the final results must be recorded to the appropriate base units.
16. System International do not allow the use of former CGS System units such as dyne, erg, gausa, poise, torr, etc.

# 1.3 UNCERTAINTY IN MEASUREMENT 

You can count the number of pages of a book exactly but measurement of its length needs some measuring instrument. Every instrument is calibrated to a certain smallest division mark on it and this fact puts a limit regarding its accuracy. When you take a reading with one instrument, its limit of measurement is the smallest division or graduation on its scale. Hence, every measured quantity has some uncertainty aboutits value. When a measurement is made, it is taken to the nearest graduation or marking on the scale. You can estimate the maximum uncertainty as being one smallest division of the instrument. This is called absolute uncertainty. It is one millimetre on a metre rule that is graduated in millimetres. For example, if one edge of the book coincides with 10.0 cm mark and the other with 33.5 cm , then the length with uncertainty is given by

$$
(33.5 \pm 0.05) \mathrm{cm}-(10.0 \pm 0.05) \mathrm{cm}=(23.5 \pm 0.1) \mathrm{cm}
$$

It means that the true length of the book is in between 23.4 cm and 23.6 cm . Hence, the maximum uncertainty is $\pm 0.05 \mathrm{~cm}$, which is equivalent to an uncertainty of 0.1 cm . Infact, it is equal to least count of the metre rule. Uncertainty may be recorded as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Fractional uncertainty }=\frac{\text { Absolute uncertainty }}{\text { Measured value }} \\
& \text { or } \quad \text { Percentage uncertainty }=\frac{\text { Absolute uncertainty }}{\text { Measured value }} \times 100 \%
\end{aligned}
$$

## Uncertainty in Digital Instruments

Some modern measuring instruments have a digital scale. We usually estimate one

# Physics II 

digit beyond what is certain: with a digital scale, this is reflected in some fluctuations of the last digit. If the last digit fluctuates by 1 or 2 , write down that last digit. If fluctuation is more than 2 or so in the last digit, it may mean that the reading is being influenced by some factor such as air currents. Regardless of the reason, a large fluctuation may mean that the displayed digit is not really significant.
The indication of uncertainty in a recorded value has been simplified using significant figures. If a measurement is recorded using the knowledge of significant figures, then its last digit, which is an estimation, is an indication of the accuracy of the recorded value.

### 1.4 USE OF SIGNIFICANT FIGURES

The number of digits of a measurement about which we do feel reasonably sure are called significant figures. Infact, they reflect the use of actual instrument used for that measurement. While using a calculator, the result of any calculation contains many digits after the decimal point. The additional digits may mislead another person who uses those figures into believing them. Hence, they are to be rounded off to the correct number of significant figures. This can be done by keeping in view the uncertainty or the least count of the instrument while recording observations and also quoting results of any calculations to the correct numbers of significant figures. It is better to quote the result in scientific notation to avoid any ambiguity regarding the number of significant figures.
For example, weighing the same object with different balances:
Electronic balance: mass $=3.145 \pm 0.001 \mathrm{~g}$
[Image removed]

Usually, the uncertainty $\pm 0.001 \mathrm{~g}$ or $\pm 0.1 \mathrm{~g}$ is dropped, and it is understood that the number quoted has an uncertainty of at least 1 unit in the last digit. All digits which are quoted are called significant figures.

In any measurement, the accurately known digits and the first estimated or doubtful digit are called significant figures.
Proper use of significant figures ensures that we correctly represent the uncertainty of our measurements. For example, scientists immediately realize that the reported mass 3.145 g is more accurate than a reported mass of 3.1 g , reflecting the use of a better or more precise instrument. As we improve the quality of our measuring instrument and techniques, we extend the result to more and more significant figures and

# Physical 

correspondingly improve the experimental accuracy of the result.

## Working with significant figures

## (i) Counting significant digits

(a) All digits $1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9$ are significant. However, zeros may or may not be significant. In case of zeros, the following rules may be adopted:
(b) Azero between two significant figures is itself significant.
(c) Zeros to the left most significant figure are not significant. For example, none of the zeros in 0.00467 or 02.59 are significant.
(d) Zeros to the right of a significant figure may or may not be significant. In decimal fraction, zeros to the right of a significant figure are significant. For example, all the zeros in 3.570 or 7.4000 are significant. However, in integers such as $8,000 \mathrm{~kg}$, the number of significant zeros is determined by the precision of the measuring instrument. If the measuring scale has a least count of 1 kg , then there are four significant figures written in scientific notation as $8.000 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~kg}$. If the least count of the scale is 10 kg , then the number of significant figures will be 3 written in scientific notation as $8.00 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~kg}$ and so on.
(e) When a measurement is recorded in scientific notation or standard form, the figures other than the powers of ten are significant figures. For example, a measurement recorded as $8.70 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~kg}$ has three significant figures.

## (ii) Multiplying or dividing numbers

Keep a number of significant figures in the product or quotient not more than that contained in the least accurate factor i.e., the factor containing the least number of significant figures. For example, the computation of the following using a calculator, gives

$$
\frac{5.348 \times 10^{-2} \times 3.64 \times 10^{4}}{1.336}-1.45768982 \times 10^{3}
$$

As the factor $3.64 \times 10^{4}$, the least accurate in the above calculation has three significant figures, the answer should be written to three significant figures only. The other figures are insignificant and should be deleted. While deleting the figures, the last significant figure to be retained is rounded off for which the following rules are followed:

Remember Thumb Rule
For calculation of end result:

- Addition / Subtraction: same precision.
- Multiplication/Division: same accuracy (Same number of significant figures).
(a) If the first digit dropped is less than 5 , the last digit retained should remain unchanged.
(b) If the first digit dropped is more than 5 , the digit to be retained is increased by one.
(c) If the digit to be dropped is 5 , the previous digit which is to be retained is increased by one if it is odd and retained as such if it is even. For example, the following numbers are rounded off to three significant figures as follows. The digits are deleted one by one.

| Physica II |  |  |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 43.75 | is rounded off as | 43.8 |
| 56.8546 | is rounded off as | 56.9 |
| 73.650 | is rounded off as | 73.6 |
| 64.350 | is rounded off as | 64.4 |

Following this rule, the correct answer of the computation given in section (ii) is $1.46 \times 10^{5}$.

## (iii) In adding or subtracting numbers

The number of decimal places retained in the answer should be equal to the smallest number of decimal places in any of the quantities being added or subtracted. In this case, the number of significant figures is not important. It is the position of decimal that matters. For example, suppose we wish to add the following quantities expressed in metres.
(a) 72.1
(b) 2.7543
3.42
4.10
0.003
1.273
75.523
8.1273
Correct answer: 75.5 m
8.13 m

## Thumb Rule for Uncertainty

For average value of many readings:

- Mean deviation from an average value.
- Periodic Uncertainty:

Divide least count of timing device by the number of oscillations.

## Cunich Oude

1. Give the correct number of significant figures for $0.0054 \mathrm{~m}, 0.03030 \mathrm{~m}$, $40.0 \mathrm{~m}, 0.6 \mathrm{~m}, 8.20 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~m}$.
2. Give the answer to the appropriate number of significant figures.
$2602 \mathrm{~kg}+36.02 \mathrm{~kg}+54.1 \mathrm{~kg}=$ ?
3. Give the answer to the appropriate number of significant figures.
$3.54 \mathrm{~kg}-2.4 \mathrm{~kg}=$ ?
4. Give the answer to the appropriate number of significant figure.
$2.45 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~m} \times 2.46 \mathrm{~m} / 3.6 \mathrm{~m}=$ ?

In case (a), the number 72.1 has the smallest decimal places, thus the answer is rounded off to the same position which is then 75.5 m . In case (b), the number 4.10 has the smallest number of decimal places and hence, the answer is rounded off to the same decimal position which is then 8.13 m .

## Limitations of Significant Figures

Significant figures deal with only one source of uncertainties that inherent in reading the scale. Real experimental uncertainties have many contributions, including personal errors and sometimes hidden systematic errors. One cannot do better than that what the scale reading allows, but the total uncertainty may well be more than what the significant figure of the measurements would suggest.

### 1.5 PRECISION AND ACCURACY

The terms precision and accuracy are frequently used in physics measurements. They should be distinguished clearly. The precision of a measurement is determined by the instrument or device being used. The smaller the least count the more precise is the measurement. Accuracy is defined

Remember Thumb Rule

- Precision: Less absolute uncertainty.
- Accuracy: Less \% age uncertainty.
as the closeness of a measurement to the exact or accepted value of a physical quantity. It is expressed by the fractional or percentage uncertainty. The smaller the fractional or

# Physica II 

percentage uncertainty, the more accurate is the measurement.
For example, the length of an object is recorded as 25.5 cm by using a metre rule having smallest division in millimetre. Its precision or absolute uncertainty (least count) $= \pm 0.1 \mathrm{~cm}$.
Fractional uncertainty $=\frac{0.1 \mathrm{~cm}}{25.5 \mathrm{~cm}}=0.004$
Percentage uncertainty $=\frac{0.1 \mathrm{~cm}}{25.5 \mathrm{~cm}} \times 100 \%=0.4 \%$
Another measurement taken by Vernier Callipers with least count 0.01 cm is recorded as 0.45 cm . It has precision or absolute uncertainty (least count) $= \pm 0.01 \mathrm{~cm}$.
Fractional uncertainty $=\frac{0.01 \mathrm{~cm}}{0.45 \mathrm{~cm}}=0.02$
Percentage uncertainty $=\frac{0.01 \mathrm{~cm}}{0.45 \mathrm{~cm}} \times 100 \%=2 \%$
Thus, the reading 25.5 cm taken by metre rule is although less precise but is more accurate having less percentage uncertainty or error.
Whereas the reading 0.45 cm taken by Vernier Callipers is more precise but is less accurate. In fact, it is the relative measurement which is important. The smaller a physical quantity, the more precise instrument should be used. Here the measurement 0.45 cm demands that a more precise instrument, such as micrometer screw gauge, with least count 0.001 cm , should nave been used. Hence, we can conclude that:
A precise measurement is the one which has less precision or absolute uncertainty and an accurate measurement is the one which has less fractional or percentage uncertainty.
We can never make an exact measurement. The best we can do is to come as close as possible with in the limitation of the measuring instrument.

### 1.6 ASSESSMENT OF TOTAL UNCERTAINTY IN THE FINAL RESULT

Knowing the uncertainties in all the factors involved in a calculation, the maximum possible uncertainty or error in the final result can be found as follows:
[Image removed]

We use many devices to measure physical quantities, such as length, time, and temperature. They all have some limit of precision.
[Image removed]

These are not decoration pieces of glass but are the earliest known exquisite and sensitive thermometers, built by the Accademia del Cimento (16671667), in Florence. They contained alcohol, some times coloured red for easier reading.

# 1. For addition and Subtraction 

Absolute uncertainties are added. For example, the distance between two positions $x=15.4 \pm 0.1 \mathrm{~cm}$ and $x_{1}=25.6 \mathrm{~cm} \pm 0.1 \mathrm{~cm}$ is recorded as:
$x=x_{2}-x_{1}=10.2 \pm 0.2 \mathrm{~cm}$
and addition of two lengths is:
$t_{1}=8.5 \pm 0.1 \mathrm{~cm}$ and $t_{2}=12.6 \pm 0.1 \mathrm{~cm}$ recorded as:
$t=t_{1}+t_{2}=21.1 \pm 0.2 \mathrm{~cm}$

## 2. For multiplication and division

For your information
Colour printing uses just four colours cyan, magenta, yellow and black to produce the entire range of colours. All the colours in this book have been made from just these four colours.

Percentage uncertainties are added. For example, the maximum possible uncertainty in the value of resistance $R$ of a conductor determined by the potential difference $V$ applied across the conductor resulting in current flowing through it is estimated as under:

Let

$$
\begin{aligned}
V & =3.4 \pm 0.1 \mathrm{~V} \\
I & =0.68 \pm 0.05 \mathrm{~A}
\end{aligned}
$$

using

$$
R=\frac{V}{I}
$$

Percentage uncertainty in $V=\frac{0.1 \mathrm{~V}}{3.4 \mathrm{~V}} \times 100 \%=3 \%$
Percentage uncertainty in $I=\frac{0.05 \mathrm{~A}}{0.58 \mathrm{~A}} \times 100 \%=7 \%$

## Thumb Rule for Total Uncertainty

- For addition and subtraction: Absolute uncertainties are added.
- For multiplication and division: Percentage uncertainties are added.
- For power factor: Power factor $x$ Percentage uncertainty

Hence, total percentage uncertainty in the value of $R$ is $3+7=10 \%$
The value of $R$ will be written as:

$$
R=\frac{3.4 \mathrm{~V}}{0.68 \mathrm{~A}}=5.0 \mathrm{ohm}
$$

Hence, $R=5.0 \pm 0.5$ ohms, uncertainty being an estimate only, is recorded by one significant figure.

## 3. For Power Factor

|  |  |
| :--: | :--: |
|  |  |

The percentage uncertainty is multiplied by the power factor in the formula. For example, the calculation of cross-sectional area of a cylinder of radius $r=1.25 \mathrm{~cm}$ using formula for Area $A=\pi r^{2}$ is given by the \%age uncertainty which is $A=2 \times \%$ age uncertainty in radius $r$. As uncertainty is multiplied by power factor, it increases the precision demand of measurement. When the radius of a small sphere is measured as 1.25 cm by Vernier Callipers with least count 0.01 cm , then
The radius ris recorded as

$$
r=1.25 \pm 0.01 \mathrm{~cm}
$$

\%age uncertainty in radius ris

$$
r=\frac{0.01}{1.25} \times 100 \%=0.8 \%
$$

Total percentage uncertainty in area $A=2 \times 0.8=1.6 \%$
Thus

$$
\begin{aligned}
A & =\pi r^{2} \\
& =3.14(1.25)^{2}=4.906 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \text { with } 1.8 \% \text { uncertainty }
\end{aligned}
$$

# Physica II 

Thus, the result should be recorded as $A=4.91 \pm 0.08 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$
Example 7.1 The length, breadth and thickness of a metal sheet are $2.03 \mathrm{~m}, 1.22 \mathrm{~m}$ and 0.95 cm respectively. Calculate the volume of the sheet correct up to the appropriate significant digits.

Solution Given Length
Breadth
Thickness
Volume

$$
\begin{aligned}
\ell & =2.03 \mathrm{~m} \\
b & =1.22 \mathrm{~m} \\
h & =0.95 \mathrm{~cm}=0.95 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m} \\
V & =\ell \times b \times h=2.03 \mathrm{~m} \times 1.22 \mathrm{~m} \times 0.95 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~m} \\
& =2.35277 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~m}^{3}
\end{aligned}
$$

As the factor 0.95 cm has minimum number of significant figures equal to two, therefore, volume is recorded up to 2 significant figures, hence, $V=2.4 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~m}^{3}$
Example 7.2 The mass of a metal box measured by a lever balance is 3.25 kg . Two silver coins of masses 10.01 g and 10.02 g measured by a beam balance are added to it. What is now the total mass of the box correct up to the appropriate precision?

## Solution

Total mass when silver coins are added to box $=3.25 \mathrm{~kg}+0.01001 \mathrm{~kg}+0.01002 \mathrm{~kg}$ $=3.27003 \mathrm{~kg}$
Since least precise mass is 3.25 kg , having two decimal places, hence, total mass should be reported to 2 decimal places which is the appropriate precision.
Thus
Total mass $=3.27 \mathrm{~kg}$
Example 7.3 The diameter and length of a metal cylinder measured with the help of Vernier Callipers of least count 0.01 cm are 1.25 cm and 3.35 cm , respectively. Calculate the volume $V$ of the cylinder and uncertainty in it.

Solution Given
Diameter
Length
Absolute uncertainty in length
\%age uncertainty in length
Absolute uncertainty in diameter
\%age uncertainty in diameter
As Volume

$$
d=1.25 \mathrm{~cm} \text { with least count } 0.01 \mathrm{~cm}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\ell & =3.35 \mathrm{~cm} \text { with least count } 0.01 \mathrm{~cm} \\
& =0.01 \mathrm{~cm} \\
& =(0.01 \mathrm{~cm} / 3.35 \mathrm{~cm}) \times 100 \%=0.3 \% \\
& =0.01 \mathrm{~cm} \\
& =(0.01 \mathrm{~cm} / 1.25 \mathrm{~cm}) \times 100 \%=0.8 \% \\
& =\pi r^{2} \ell=\pi \frac{d^{2}}{4} \ell
\end{aligned}
$$

Total uncertainty in $V=2$ (\%age uncertainty in diameter) + (\%age uncertainty in length) $=2 \times 0.8 \%+0.3 \%=1.9 \%$
Then
Thus

$$
V=3.14 \times(1.25 \mathrm{~cm})^{2} \times 3.35 \mathrm{~cm} / 4=4.1089842 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} \text { with } 1.9 \% \text { uncertainty }
$$

$V=(4.11 \pm 0.08) \mathrm{cm}^{3}$
where $4.11 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ is calculated volume and $0.08 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ is the uncertainty in it.

# 1.7 DIMENSIONS OF PHYSICAL QUANTITIES 

Any physical quantity can be described by certain familiar properties such as length, mass, time, temperature, electric current, etc. These measurable properties are called dimensions. Dimensions deal with the qualitative nature of a physical quantity in terms of fundamental quantities. The quantities such as length, depth, height, diameter, light year are all measured in metre and denoted by the same dimension, basically known as length given by symbol $L$ written within square brackets [L]. Similarly, the other fundamental quantities, mass, time, electric current and temperature are denoted by specific symbols [M], [T], [A] and [6], respectively. These five dimensions have been chosen as being basic because they are easy to measure in experiments.
The dimensions of other quantities indicate how they are related to the basic quantities and are combination of fundamental dimensions. For example, speed $v$ is measured in metres per second, so it has the dimensions of length [L] divided by time [T].

$$
[v]=[L] /[T]=[L]\left[T^{2}\right]=\left[\mathrm{LT}^{2}\right]
$$

As the acceleration $a=\Delta v / \Delta t$
Dimensions of acceleration are

$$
[a]=[v] /[T]=\left[\mathrm{LT}^{2}\right] /[T]=\left[\mathrm{LT}^{2}\right]
$$

Also, dimensions of force can be written as

$$
[F]=[m][a]=[M]\left[\mathrm{LT}^{2}\right]=\left[\mathrm{MLT}^{2}\right]
$$

By the use of dimensionality, we can check the homogeneity (correctness) of a physical equation, and also, we can derive formula for a physical quantity.

## Homogeneity of Physical Equations

The correctness of an equation can be checked by showing that the dimensions of quantities on both sides of the equation are the same. This is known as principle of homogeneity.
Suppose a car starts from rest $\left(v_{i}=0\right)$ and covers a distance $S$ in time $t$ moving with an acceleration a. The
[Image removed]

The ceslum atomic frequency standard at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Colorado (USA). It is the primary standard for the unit of time.

equation of motion is given by,

$$
S=v_{1} t+\frac{1}{2} a t^{2}
$$

or

$$
S=\frac{1}{2} a t^{2}
$$

Numerical factors like $1 / 2$ have no dimensions, so they can be ignored. By putting the dimensions of both sides of the equation:

$$
[S]=[a]\left[t^{2}\right]
$$

Writing the symbols of dimensions $[L]=\left[\mathrm{LT}^{2}\right]\left[\mathrm{T}^{2}\right]$

$$
[L]=\left[\mathrm{LT}^{2} \mathrm{~T}^{2}\right]
$$

or

$$
[L]=[L]
$$

This shows that dimensions on both sides of equation are the same, therefore, the equation is dimensionally correct.

# Derivation of a Formula 

Dimensionality can be used to derive a possible formula for a phyaical quantity by correct estimation of various factors on which the quantity depends.
[Image removed]

The davice which made the pendulum clock practicai.

Example 1.4 Derive a formula for the centripetal force required to keep an object moving along a circle with uniform speed. Assuming that centripetal force depends on mass of the object, radius of the circle and uniform speed.
Solution As force depends on mass $m$ of the object, radius $r$ of the circle and uniform speed $v$, we can write:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& F a m^{2} v^{2} r^{2} \\
& F=\left(\text { constant }\right) m^{2} v^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

where the exponents (powers) $a, b$ and $c$ are to be determined. By the principle of homogeneity, the dimensions on both sides of the equation should be the same. Since, constant has no dimension so by ignoring it, we write the above equation in terms of dimensions as,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& {[F]=\left[m^{2}\right]\left[v^{2}\right]\left[r^{2}\right]} \\
& {\left[\mathrm{MLT}^{2}\right]=\left[\mathrm{M}^{2}\right]\left[\mathrm{L} / \mathrm{T}\right]^{2}\left[\mathrm{~L}^{2}\right]} \\
& {\left[\mathrm{MLT}^{2}\right]=\left[\mathrm{M}^{2}\right]\left[\mathrm{LT}^{-1}\right]^{2}\left[\mathrm{~L}^{2}\right]} \\
& {\left[\mathrm{MLT}^{2}\right]=\left[\mathrm{M}^{2} \mathrm{~L}^{2-2} \mathrm{~T}^{2}\right]}
\end{aligned}
$$

Comparing the powers of dimensions on both sides of the above equation, we have

$$
a=1
$$

## Bevare!

Calculators are designed to yield as many digits as the memory of the calculator chip permits. Hence, be sure to round off the final answers of calculations down to correct number of significant figures.

$$
\begin{aligned}
b+c & =1 \\
-b & =-2
\end{aligned}
$$

Solving the above equations, we have $a=1, b=2, c=-1$
Putting the values of $a, b$ and $c$ in equation (i), we have

$$
F=(\text { constant }) m v^{2} r^{1}
$$

or

$$
F=(\text { constant }) m v^{2} / r
$$

The numerical value of the constant cannot be determined by dimensional analysis. However, it can be found by experiments. In the above equation, numerical value of the constant happens to be " 1 ", so the equation reduces to:

$$
F=m v^{2} / r
$$

# Limitations in Dimensional Analysis 

The dimensional method cannot identify where an equation is wrong. Even if an equation is proved correct, we can only say the equation might be correct, for the reason that the method does not provide a check on any numerical factor or constant. That can only be determined by experiments or plotting some suitable graph between the variables.

### Learning Objectives

After studying this chapter, the students will be able to:

- Differentiate between scalar and vector quantities
- Represent a vector in 2-D as two perpendicular components
- Describe the product of two vectors (dot and cross-product) along with their properties
- Derive the equations of motion [For uniform acceleration cases only. Derive from the definitions of velocity and acceleration as well as graphically]
- Solve problems using the equations of motion [For the cases of uniformly accelerated motion in a straight line, including the motion of bodies falling in a uniform gravitational field without air resistance. This also includes situations where the equations of motion need to be resolved into vertical and horizontal components for 2-D motion]
- Evaluate and analyse projectile motion in the absence of air resistance [This includes solving problems making use of the below facts:
  - (i) Horizontal component (V, J) of velocity is constant
  - (ii) Acceleration is in the vertical direction and is the same as that of a vertically free falling object
  - (iii) The horizontal motion and vertical motion are independent of each other. Situations may require students to determine for projectiles:
    - How high does it go?
    - How far would it go along the level (and)?
    - Where would it be after a given time?
    - How long will it remain in flight?
  - Situations may also require students to calculate for a projectile launched from ground height the launch angle that results in the maximum range:
    - Relation between the launch angles that result in the same range.
- Predict qualitatively how air resistance affects projectile motion. [This includes analysis of both the horizontal component and vertical component of velocity and hence predicting qualitatively the range of the projectile]
- Apply the principle of conservation of momentum to solve simple problems [including elastic and inelastic interactions between objects in both one and two dimensions. Knowledge of the concept of coefficient of restitution is not required. Examples of applications include:
  - Kerata chops to break a pile of bricks
  - Car crashes
  - Ball & ball
  - The motion under thrust of a rocket in a straight line considering short thrusts during which the mass remains constant]
- Predict and analyse motion for elastic collisions [This includes making use of the fact that for an elastic collision, total kinetic energy is conserved and the relative speed of approach is equal to the relative speed of separation]
- Justify how the momentum of a closed system is always conserved, some change in kinetic energy may take place.

# BASIC CONCEPT OF SCALARS AND VECTORS 

Scalars and vectors are basic concepts in physics. Many problems in physics require to distinguish between scalar and vector quantities to apply the correct mathematical and conceptual approaches. Understanding scalars and vectors help us to grasp how Physics applies to real-world situations, such as calculating the total distance travelled (scalar) or determining the magnitude and direction of force (vector). Learning these concepts develops critical thinking and problem-solving skills. This chapter is primarily concerned with vector algebra and its application in uniform accelerated motion, in a straight line, motion of freely falling bodies in uniform gravitational field, projectile motion, and interaction between objects in one and two dimensions.

### 2.1 SCALARS

Scalars are physical quantities that are described solely by a magnitude (size or amount) without any mention of direction. Thus, scalars are directionless and can be fully characterized by a single number and its associated unit.

## Examples:

Mass: The amount of matter in an object. For example, 2 kg .
Distance: The total length of the path travelled by an object irrespective of the direction. For example, 50 m .
Speed: The rate at which an object covers distance. For example, $40 \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~h}^{-1}$.
Time: The duration between two events taking place. For example, 20 s .
Energy: The capacity to do work. For example, 25 J .
Temperature: A measure of the average kinetic energy of particles in a substance. For example, $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

### 2.2 VECTORS

Those physical quantities which require magnitude as well as direction for their complete specification are known as vectors.

## Examples:

Displacement: The change in position of an object. It has length, a distance (magnitude) and a direction (e.g. 10 m towards west).
Velocity: The speed of an object in a particular direction (e.g., $50 \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~h}^{-1}$ towards west).
Acceleration: The rate of change of velocity that occurs in either speed or direction or both (e.g., $10 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}$ upward).
Force: A push or pull acting on an object, determined by its magnitude and direction (e.g; 20 N to the right)

# Graphical Representation of a Vector 

A good way to represent a vector quantity is to use a vector diagram, in which vectors are often represented by arrows. The length of the arrows indicates the magnitude and the head of the arrow shows the direction of the vector. Vectors are typically denoted by bold face letters (e.g; $\mathrm{V}, \mathrm{F}$ ) or an arrow above symbol ( $\overline{\mathrm{A}}$ ).

## Rectangular Components of a Vector

A component of a vector is its effective value in a given direction. A vector may be considered as the resultant of its component vectors along the specified directions. It is usually convenient to resolve a vector into its components along the mutually perpendicular directions. Such components are called rectangular components.
Let there be a vector $A$ represented by a line $O P$ making an angle $\theta$ with the $x$-axis. Draw projection $O M$ of vector $A$ on $x$-axis and projection $O N$ of vector $A$ on $y$-axis as shown in Fig.2.1. Projection OM being along $x$-direction is represented by $A_{x}$ and projection $O N$ along $y$-direction is represented by $A_{y}$. By applying head to tail rule:

$$
A=A_{x}+A_{y}
$$

[Image removed]

Thus, $A_{x}$ and $A_{y}$ are the comoponants of vector $A$. Since these are at right angles to each other, they are called rectangular components of $A$. Considering the right angled triangle OMP, the magnitude of $A_{x}$ or $x$-component of $A$ is:

$$
A_{x}=A \cos \theta
$$

And the magnitude of $A_{x}$ or $y$-component of $A$ is:

$$
A_{y}=A \sin \theta
$$

## Determination of a Vector from its Rectangular Components

If the rectangular components of a vector as shown in Fig.(2.1) are given, we can find out the magnitude of the vector by using Pythagorean Theorem.
In the right angle $\triangle O M P$

$$
\begin{aligned}
(O P)^{2} & =(O M)^{2}+(M P)^{2} \\
A^{2} & =A_{x}^{2}+A_{y}^{2} \\
A & =\sqrt{A_{x}^{2}+A_{y}^{2}}
\end{aligned}
$$

The direction $\theta$ is given by

$$
\tan \theta=\frac{M P}{O M}=\frac{A_{y}}{A_{x}}
$$

or

$$
\theta=\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{A_{y}}{A_{x}}\right)
$$

# 2.3 PRODUCT OF TWO VECTORS 

There are two types of vector multiplications. The product of these two types are known as scalar product and vector product.

If the product of two vectors results in a scalar quantity, it is called scalar product while if the product of two vectors results in a vector quantity, it is called vector product.

## Scalar or Dot Product

The scalar product of two vectors $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ is written as $\mathbf{A} . \mathbf{B}$ and is defined as:

$$
A . B=A B \cos \theta
$$

where $A$ and $B$ are the magnitudes of vectors $A$ and $B$ and $\theta$ is the angle between them.
For physical interpretation of dot product of two vectors $A$ and B, these are first brought to a common origin (Fig.2.2-e) then, $A . B=A$ (projection of $B$ on $A$ )
or
[Image removed]

Fig. 2.2 (e)

A. $B=A$ (magnitude of component of $B$ in the direction of $A$ ), Fig.2.2(b)

$$
=A(B \cos \theta)=A B \cos \theta
$$

Similarly

$$
B . A=B(A \cos \theta)=B A \cos \theta
$$

This type of product when we consider the work done by a force $F$ whose point of application moves a distance $d$ in a direction making an angle $\theta$ with the line of action of $F$, as shown in Fig. 2.3.
Work done $=$ (Effective component of force in the direction of motion) $\times$ Distance moved

$$
=(F \cos \theta) d=F d \cos \theta
$$

Using vector notation:
F.d $=F d \cos \theta=$ Work done

# Characteristics of Scalar Product 

1. Since $A . B=A B \cos \theta$ and $B . A=B A \cos \theta=A B \cos \theta$, hence, $A . B=B . A$. The order of multiplication is irrelevant. In other words, scalar product is commutative.
2. The scalar product of two mutually perpendicular vectors $\left(\theta=90^{\circ}\right)$ is zero.

$$
A . B=A B \cos 90^{\circ}=0
$$

3. The scalar product of two parallel vectors is equal to the product of their magnitudes. Thus, for parallel vectors $\left(\theta=0^{\circ}\right)$

$$
A . B=A B \cos 0^{\circ}=A B
$$

For antiparallel vectors $\left(\theta=180^{\circ}\right)$

$$
A . B=A B \cos 180^{\circ}=-A B
$$

4. The self product of a vector $A$ is equal to square of its magnitude.

$$
A . A=A A \cos 0^{\circ}=A^{2}
$$

5. Scalar product of two vectors $A$ and $B$ in terms of their rectangular components

$$
A . B=A_{x} B_{y}+A_{y} B_{z}+A_{z} B_{z}
$$

Equation (2.6) can be used to find the angle between two vectors. Since,

$$
A . B=A B \cos \theta=A_{x} B_{x}+A_{y} B_{y}+A_{z} B_{z}
$$

Therefore

$$
\cos \theta=\frac{A_{x} B_{y}+A_{y} B_{y}+A_{z} B_{z}}{A B}
$$

# Vector or Cross Product 

The vector product of two vectors $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$, is a vector which is defined as:

$$
A \times B=A B \sin \theta \hat{n}
$$

where $\hat{n}$ is a unit vector perpendicular to the plane containing $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ as shown in Fig. 2.4 (a). Its direction can be determined by right hand rule. For that purpose, place together the tail of vectors $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ to define the plane of vectors $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$. The direction of the product vector is perpendicular to this plane. Rotate the First vector $\mathbf{A}$ into $\mathbf{B}$ through the smaller of the two possible angles and curl the fingers of the right hand in the direction of rotation, keeping the thumb erect. The direction of the product vector will be along the erect thumb, as shown in the Fig 2.4 (b). Because of this direction rule, $\mathbf{B} \times \mathbf{A}$ is a vector opposite in sign to $\mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{B}$ (Fig. 2.4-c). Hence,
[Image removed]

## Characteristics of Cross Product

1. Since $\mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{B}$ is not the same as $\mathbf{B} \times \mathbf{A}$, the cross product is non commutative. so,

$$
A \times B \neq B \times A
$$

2. The cross product of two perpendicular vectors $\left(\theta=90^{\circ}\right)$ has maximum magnitude.

$$
A \times B=A B \sin 90^{\circ} \hat{n}=A B \hat{n}
$$

3. The cross product of two parallel or anti-parallel vectors is a null vector, because for such vectors $\theta=0^{\circ}$ or $180^{\circ}$. Hence,

$$
A \times B=A B \sin 0^{\circ} \hat{n}=0 \text { or } A \times B=A B \sin 180^{\circ} \hat{n}=0
$$

As a consequence $\mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{A}=\mathbf{0}\left(\theta=0^{\circ}\right)$
4. The magnitude of $\mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{B}$ is equal to the area of the parallelogram formed with $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$

as two adjacent sides (Fig.2.4-d).

# Examples of Vector Product 

i. When a force $F$ is applied on a rigid body at a point whose position vector is $\mathbf{r}$ from any point on the axis about which the body rotates, then the turning effect of the force called the torque $\tau$ is given by the vector product of $r$ and $F$.

$$
\tau=r \times F
$$

ii. The force $F$ on a particle of charge $q$ and velocity $v$ in a magnetic field of strength $B$ is given by vector product of $v$ and $B$.

$$
F=q(v \times B)
$$

### 2.4 EQUATIONS OF MOTIONS

Equations of motion can be used to describe the motion of an object in terms of its three kinematic variables: velocity $v$, position $S$ and time $t$. There are three ways to pair these variables up: velocity-time, position-time and velocity-position. In this order, they are called first equation of motion, second equation of motion and third equation of motion, respectively.
These equations of motion can only be applied to those objects, which are moving in a straight line with constant acceleration.

## Derivation of First Equation of Motion

Suppose a body is moving with uniform acceleration along a straight line with an initial velocity $v_{i}$. Suppose its velocity changes from initial value $v_{i}$ to a final value $v_{f}$ in time interval $t$. Then the acceleration produced in the body during this time interval is given as:

$$
a=\frac{v_{i}-v_{i}}{t}
$$

Rearranging, we can write

$$
\begin{aligned}
v_{i}-v_{i} & =a t \\
v_{i} & =v_{i}+a t
\end{aligned}
$$

This is the first equation of motion. It correlates the final velocity attained by a body with initial velocity and the time interval $t$, when moving with constant acceleration $a$.

## Derivation of First Equation of Motion By Graphical Method

First equation of motion can be derived using velocity-time graph for an object moving with initial velocity $v_{i}$ final velocity $v_{f}$ and constant acceleration $a$.
Let the velocity of a body at point $A$ be $v_{i}$ which changes to $v_{i}$ at point $B$ in time interval $t$ as shown in Fig.2.5. A perpendicular BD is drawn from point $B$ to $x$-axis and another perpendicular BE from B on $y$-axis, such that

$$
\begin{aligned}
& O A=v_{i}=\text { Initial velocity of the body } \\
& O E=D B=v_{i}=\text { Final velocity of the body }
\end{aligned}
$$

From the graph, it can observed that:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& D B=D C+C B \\
& D B=O A+C B \quad(\text { As } \quad O A=D C)
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore

$$
v_{i}=C B+v_{i} \quad(2.12)
$$

[Image removed]

Fig. 2.5: Velocity-Time Graph
The value of $C B$ in the above equation can be determined by taking the slope of line $A B$, which is equal to acceleration $a$.

$$
a=\frac{C B}{A C}
$$

As

$$
A C=t
$$

So

$$
a=\frac{C B}{t}
$$

or

$$
B C=a t
$$

(2.13)

Combining Eqs. (2.12) and (2.13), we have

$$
v_{i}=v_{i}+a t
$$

This is the first equation of motion.

# Derivation of Second Equation of Motion 

Suppose a body is moving with uniform acceleration a along a straight line with an initial velocity $v_{i}$, which become $v_{i}$ after time interval $t$. Let it covers a distance $S$ in a particular direction during time $t$, then using the definition of velocity as rate of change of displacement, we can write
or

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Velocity } \quad=\text { Displacement } / \text { Time } \\
& \text { Displacement }=\text { Velocity } \times \text { Time }
\end{aligned}
$$

If velocity of the body is not constant, we can use average velocity instead of velocity.
Thus

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Displacement }=\text { Average velocity } \times \text { Time } \\
& \text { Displacement }=\frac{(\text { Initial velocity }+(\text { Final velocity })}{2} \times \text { Time } \\
& S=\frac{\left(v_{i}+v_{i}\right)}{2} \times t
\end{aligned}
$$

Using first equation of motion,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& S=\frac{\left(v_{i}+v_{i}+a t\right)}{2} \times t \\
& S=\frac{\left(2 v_{i}+a t\right)}{2} \times t
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 2 S=2 v_{1} t+a t^{2} \\
& S=v_{1} t+\frac{1}{2} a t^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

This is the second equation of motion.

# Derivation of Second Equation of Motion by Graphical Method 

Second equation of motion can be derived using velocity-time graph for a body moving with initial velocity $v_{1}$ which attains a final value $v_{f}$ in time interval $t$. While moving with constant acceleration $a$, it covers a displacement $S$ in time $t$.
It can be seen from the graph that distance travelled by the body is, $S=v \times t$.
Also

$$
\begin{aligned}
& S=\text { Area of the figure OABD } \\
& S=(\text { Area of the rectangle } O A C D)+(\text { Area of the triangle } A B C) \\
& S=(\mathrm{OA} \times \mathrm{OD})+\frac{1}{2}(\mathrm{AC} \times \mathrm{BC})
\end{aligned}
$$

As

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{OA} & =v_{1} \text { and } \mathrm{OD}=\mathrm{AC}=t . \mathrm{So} \text {, the above equation becomes: } \\
S & =v_{1} \times t+\frac{1}{2}(i \times B C)
\end{aligned}
$$

Here $B C=a t$ (From graphical representation of first equation of motion). By putting this value in the above equation, we have

$$
S=v_{1} t+\frac{1}{2}(i \times a t)
$$

$$
S=v_{1} t+\frac{1}{2} a t^{2}
$$

This is the second equation of motion.

## Derivation of third equation of motion

Consider a body moving along a straight line with an initial velocity $v_{1}$ which attains a final value $v_{f}$ in time $t$. Let the displacement of the body be $S$ during this time interval. Then, we can write:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Displacement } & =\left(\frac{\text { Initial velocity }+ \text { Final velocity }}{2}\right) \times \text { Time } \\
S & =\frac{\left(v_{1}+v_{f}\right)}{2} \times t \\
2 S & =\left(v_{f}+v_{f}\right) \times t
\end{aligned}
$$

Using the first equation of motion:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& v_{f}=v_{1}+a t \\
& t=\frac{v_{f}-v_{f}}{a}
\end{aligned}
$$

Putting the value of $t$ in Eq. (2.15)

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 2 S=\left(v_{1}+v_{1}\right)\left(\frac{v_{1}-v_{1}}{a}\right) \\
& 2 a S-v_{1}^{2}-v_{1}^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

This is the third equation of motion.

# Derivation of third Equation of Motion by Graphical method 

In the speed-time graph shown in the figure, the total distance $S$ travelled by a body is given by the area $O A B D$ under the graph, such that

$$
\begin{aligned}
& S=\frac{1}{2} \quad \text { (Sum of parallel sides) } \times \text { Height } \\
& S=\frac{1}{2}(O A+B D) \times O D
\end{aligned}
$$

Since

$$
O A=v_{1}, B D=v_{1} \text { and } O D=t
$$

The above equation becomes:

$$
S=\frac{1}{2}\left(v_{1}+v_{1}\right) \times t
$$

From first equation of motion,

$$
t=\frac{v_{1}-v_{1}}{a}
$$

Putting $t$ in above equation

$$
S=\frac{1}{2}\left(v_{1}+v_{1}\right) \frac{\left(v_{1}-v_{1}\right)}{a}
$$

or

$$
S=\frac{1}{2}\left(v_{1}+v_{1}\right) \frac{\left(v_{1}-v_{1}\right)}{a}
$$

$$
2 a S=v_{1}^{2}-v_{1}^{2}
$$

This is the third equation of motion.
The equations of motion are useful in solving the problems relating to linear motion with uniform acceleration, when an object moves along a straight line. If its direction of motion does not change, then all the vector quantities can be manipulated like scalars. In such cases, initial velocity is taken as positive. A negative sign is assigned to quantities where direction is opposite to that of initial velocity. In the absence of air resistance, all objects in free fall at the surface of the Earth, move towards the Earth with a uniform acceleration. This acceleration is known as acceleration due to gravity, denoted by $g$ and its average value at the Earth surface is taken as $9.8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}$ in the downward direction. The equation for uniformly accelerated motion can also be applied to free fall motion of the object by replacing a by g .

Example 2.2 A car travelling at $10 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ accelerates uniformally at $2 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}$. Calculate its velocity after 5 s .
Solution $v_{1}=10 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$
$a=2 \mathrm{~ms}^{-2}$
$t=5 \mathrm{~s}$
$v_{1}=$ ?
Using first equation of motion, we can write

$$
\begin{aligned}
& v_{1}=v_{1}+a t \\
& v_{1}=10 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}+2 \mathrm{~ms}^{-2} \times 5 \mathrm{~s} \\
& v_{1}=10 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}+10 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1} \\
& v_{1}=20 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

Example 2.3 A car travels with initial velocity of $15 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. It accelerates at a rate of $2 \mathrm{~ms}^{-2}$ for 4 seconds. Find the displacement of the car.

# Solution 

$$
\begin{aligned}
& v_{1}=15 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1} \\
& a=2 \mathrm{~ms}^{-2} \\
& t=4 \mathrm{~s}
\end{aligned}
$$

Displacement $S=$ ?
By using 2nd equation of motion

$$
S=v_{1}^{2}+\frac{1}{2} a t^{2}
$$

Putting the values

$$
S=\left(15 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1} \times 4 \mathrm{~s}\right)+\frac{1}{2}\left(2 \mathrm{~ms}^{-2}\right)(4 \mathrm{~s})^{2}
$$

$$
S=76 \mathrm{~m}
$$

Example 2.4 In a short distance race, a contestant in a car starts from rest and reaches the velocity of $300 \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~h}^{-1}$, after covering a distance of 0.45 km at a constant acceleration. Find this constant acceleration.

Solution Initial velocity $=v_{1}=0$
Final velocity $=v_{1}=300 \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~h}^{-1}$

$$
v_{1}=\frac{300 \times 1000}{60 \times 60} \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}
$$

$$
=83.33 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}
$$

Distance covered $=S=0.45 \mathrm{~km}=0.45 \times 1000 \mathrm{~m}=450 \mathrm{~m}$
Using third equation of motion, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
v_{t}^{2}-v_{t}^{2} & =2 a S \\
\left(83.33 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\right)^{2}-(0)^{2} & =2 \times a \times 450 \mathrm{~m} \\
a & =\frac{6943.88 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2}}{900 \mathrm{~m}} \\
a & =7.72 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}
\end{aligned}
$$

# 2.5 MOTION UNDER GRAVITY 

A body falling freely under the action of gravity is the most familiar example of uniformly accelerated rectilinear motion. According to Gallio, all bodies fall freely (in vacuum) under the acceleration due to gravity, denoted by ' $g$ '. Its experimental value is $9.8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ in SI units. This means that different bodies, when allowed to fall from the same height, strike the ground with the same velocity. As regards the sign of $g$, it is taken positive for a falling body (when initial velocity is zero) and negative for a body projected vertically upward (when initial velocity is not zero).
The equations of motion for a freely falling body, on putting $a=g$, become

$$
\begin{gathered}
v_{t}=v_{t}+g t \\
S=h=v_{t} t+\frac{1}{2} g t^{2} \\
v_{t}^{2}-v_{t}^{2}=2 g h
\end{gathered}
$$

Example 2.5. An iron ball of mass 1 kg is dropped from a tower. The ball reaches the ground in 3.34 s . Find: (a) the velocity of the ball on striking the ground, (b) the height of the tower.

Solution Since the ball is falling under the action of gravity, we shall putt $a=g$ in equations of motion.

(a) Using first equation of motion:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& v_{1}=v_{1}+g t \\
& v_{1}=0+\left(9.8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\right)(3.34 \mathrm{~s}) \\
& v_{1}=32.7 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

(b) Using third equation of motion:

$$
\begin{aligned}
v_{1}^{2}-v_{1}^{2} & =2 g h \\
\left(32.7 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\right)^{2}-(0)^{2} & =2 \times 9.8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-2} \times h \\
h & =\frac{1069.29 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}}{19.6 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}} \\
h & =54.56 \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}
$$

# 2.6 PROJECTILE MOTION 

Uptill now we have been studying the motion of a particle along a straight line i.e., motion in one dimension. Now we consider the motion of a ball, when it is thrown horizontally from certain height. It is observed that the ball travels forward as well as falls downward, until it strikes something such as ground. Suppose that the ball leaves the hand of the thrower at pointA(Fig 2.8-a) and that its velocity at that instant is completely horizontal. Let this velocity be $v_{1}$. According to Newton's first law of motion, there will be no acceleration in horizontal direction, unless a horizontally directed force acts on the ball. Ignoring the air friction, only force acting on the ball during flight is the force of gravity. There is no horizontal force acting on it. So, its horizontal velocity will remain unchanged and will be $v_{1}$, until the ball hits the ground. The horizontal motion of ball is simple. The ball moves with constant horizontal velocity component. Hence, horizontal distance $x$ is given by

$$
x=v_{x} \times t
$$

Fig. 2.8(b)

It is not necessary that an object should be thrown with some initial velocity in the horizontal direction. A football kicked off by a player; a ball thrown by a cricketer and a missile fired from a launching pad, all projected at some angles with the horizontal, are called projectiles.

Projectile motion is two dimensional motion under constant acceleration due to gravity.

In such cases, the motion of a projectile can be studied easily by resolving it into horizontal and vertical components which are independent of each other. Suppose that a projectile is fired in a direction angle $\theta$ with the horizontal by velocity $v_{1}$ as shown in Fig.2.8(b). Let components of velocity $v_{1}$ along the horizontal and vertical directions be $v_{1} \cos \theta$ and $v_{1} \sin \theta$, respectively. The horizontal acceleration is $a_{v}=0$ because we have neglected air resistance and no other force is acting along this direction, whereas the vertical acceleration is $a_{v}=g$. Hence, the horizontal component $v_{n}$ remains constant and at any time $t$, we have

$$
v_{n}=v_{n}=v_{1} \cos \theta
$$

Now we consider the vertical motion. The initial vertical component of the velocity is $v_{1} \sin \theta$ in the upward direction.
The vertical component $v_{0}$ at any instant $t$ can be determined by considering the upward motion of projectile as free fall motion $\left(a_{v}=-g\right)$. Using 1st equation of motion:

$$
v_{f v}=v_{1} \sin \theta-g t
$$

The magnitude of velocity at any instant is:

$$
v=\sqrt{v_{f v}^{2}+v_{f v}^{2}}
$$

The angle $\phi$ which this resultant velocity makes with the horizontal can be found from

$$
\tan \phi=\frac{v_{f v}}{v_{f v}}
$$

In projectile motion one may wish to determine the height to which the projectile rises, the time of flight and horizontal range. These are described below.

# Height of the Projectile 

In order to determine the maximum height the projectile attains, we use the equation of motion:

$$
2 a S=v_{i}^{2}-v_{i}^{2}
$$

As body moves upward, $a=-g$, the initial vertical velocity $v_{0}=v_{i} \sin \theta=v_{i}$ as $v_{0}=0=v_{i}$, because the body comes to rest after reaching the highest point. Since

$$
\begin{aligned}
S & =\text { height }=h \\
-2 g h & =0-v_{i}^{2} \sin ^{2} \theta
\end{aligned}
$$

or

$$
h=\frac{v_{i}^{2} \sin ^{2} \theta}{2 g}
$$

The height of projectile will be reduced in presence of air resistance. In the presence of air resistance, the upward velocity of the projectile will decrease and hence its height will also decrease during time $t$.

# Time of Flight 

The time taken by body to cover the distance from the place of tis projection to the place where it hits the ground is called the time of flight.
This can be obtained by taking $S=h=0$, because body goes up and comes back to the same level, thus covering no vertical distance. If the body is projecting with velocity $v_{i}$ making angle $\theta$ with the horizontal, then its vertical component will be $v_{i} \sin \theta$. Hence, the equation of motion is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& S=v_{i} t+\frac{1}{2} g t^{2} \\
& 0=v_{i} \sin \theta t \frac{1}{2} g t^{2} \\
& t=\frac{2 v_{i} \sin \theta}{g}
\end{aligned}
$$

where $f$ is the time of flight of the projectile when it is projected from the ground.

## Range of the projectile

Maximum distance which a projectile covers in the horizontal direction is called the range of the projectile.
To determine the range $R$ of the projectile, we multiply the horizontal component of the velocity of projection with total time taken by the body to hit the ground after leaving the point of projection. Thus,

$$
R=v_{N} \times t
$$

or

$$
R=\frac{v_{i} \cos \theta \times 2 v_{i} \sin \theta}{g}
$$

or

$$
R=\frac{v_{i}^{2}}{g} 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta
$$

[Image removed]

For an angle less than $45^{\circ}$, the height reached by the projectile and the range both will be less. When the angle of projectile is larger than $45^{\circ}$, the height attained will be more but the range is again less.

# Physica II 

As $2 \sin \theta \cos \theta=\sin 2 \theta$, thus, the range of the projectile depends upon the velocity of projection and the angle of projection.

Therefore

$$
R=\frac{v_{1}^{2}}{g} \sin 2 \theta
$$

For maximum range $R$, the factor $\sin 2 \theta=1$, so

$$
2 \theta=\sin ^{-1}(1) \text { or } 2 \theta=90^{\circ} \quad \text { or } \quad \theta=45^{\circ}
$$

Air resistance will slow down projectile forward motion, reducing its velocity $v_{1}$. The reduction in $v_{1}$ will result in a decrease in the range of projectile.
Furthermore, air resistance is not constant throughout the flight of the object. As the object slows down, the air resistance experienced by it also decreases. This means that the object retards more slowly and accelerates more slowly as it falls down. This results in a trajectory that is not perfectly parabolic but is skewed, with steeper descent than ascent.

Example 2.6 A ball is thrown with a speed of $30 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ in a direction $30^{\circ}$ above the horizon. Determine the height to which it rises, the time of flight and the horizontal range.

Solution Initially

$$
\begin{aligned}
& v_{1}=v_{1} \cos \theta=30 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1} \times \cos 30^{\circ}=25.98 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\
& v_{1}=v_{1} \sin \theta=30 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1} \times \sin 30^{\circ}=15 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

As the time of flight, is

$$
\begin{aligned}
t & =\frac{2 v_{1}}{g} \sin \theta \\
& =\frac{2 \times 30 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-}}{9.8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}} \times(0.5) \\
\text { So } & =\frac{2 \times 15 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-}}{9.8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}}=3.1 \mathrm{~s} \\
\text { Height } & h=\frac{v_{1}^{2} \sin ^{2} \theta}{2 g} \\
\text { So } & h=\frac{\left(30 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\right)^{2}(0.5)^{2}}{19.6 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}} \\
& h=11.5 \mathrm{~m} \\
\text { Range } & R=\frac{v_{1}^{2}}{g} \sin 2 \theta=\frac{v_{1}^{2}}{g} \sin 60^{\circ} \\
\text { So } & R=\frac{\left(30 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\right)^{2} \times 0.866}{9.8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}} \\
& =79.53 \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}
$$

In the presence of air friction the trajectory of a high speed projectile falls short of a parabolic path.

# 2.7 MOMENTUM 

We are aware of the fact that moving object possesses a quality by virtue of which it exerts a force on anything that tries to stop it. The faster the object is travelling, the harder it is to stop it. Similarly, if two objects move with the same velocity, then it is more difficult to stop the massive of the two. Newton referred to this property as "momentum", a vector quantity defined as the product of an object's mass and velocity. This term is now called linear momentum $p$ of the body and is defined by the relation:

$$
p=m \vee \ldots \ldots \ldots(2.25)
$$

In this expression, $v$ is the velocity of the mass $m$. Linear momentum is, therefore, a vector quantity and has the direction of velocity. The SI unit of momentum is kilogram metre per second ( $\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{m} \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ ). It can also be expressed as newton second (Ns).

## Momentum and Newton's Second Law of Motion

Consider a body of mass $m$ moving with an initial velocity $v_{i}$. Suppose an external force $F$ acts upon it for time $t$ after which velocity becomes $v_{i}$. The acceleration a produced by this force is given by

$$
a=\frac{v_{i}-v_{i}}{t}
$$

By Newton's second law, the acceleration is given as:

$$
a=\frac{F}{m}
$$

Equating the two expressions of acceleration, we have

$$
\frac{F}{m}=\frac{v_{i}-v_{i}}{t}
$$

or

$$
F \times t=m v_{i}-m v_{i}
$$

where $m v_{1}$ is the initial momentum and $m v_{r}$ is the final momentum of the body.
[Image removed]

Which hurt you in the above situations (a) or (b) and think why?

The equation (2.26) shows that change in momentum is equal to the product of force and the time for which force is applied. This form of the second law is more general than the form $F=m a_{1}$ because it can easily be extended to account for changes as the body accelerates when its mass also changes. For example, as a rocket accelerates, it loses mass because its fuel is burnt and ejected to provide greater thrust. From Eq. (2.28)

$$
F=\frac{m v_{1}-m v_{1}}{t}
$$

Thus, second law of motion can also be stated in terms of momentum as:

Can a moving object experience impulse?

## Do you know?

Your hair acts like a crumple zone on your skull. A force of 5 N might be enough to fracture your naked skull (uranium), but with a covering of skin and hair, a force of 50 N would be needed.

Time rate of change of momentum of a body is equal to the applied force.

# Impulse 

Sometimes we wish to apply the concept of momentum to cases where the applied force is not constant, it acts for very short time. For example, when a bat hits a cricket ball, the force certainly varies from instant to instant during the collision. In such cases, it is more convenient to deal with the product of force and time ( $F \times t$ ) instead of either quantity alone. The product of average force $F$ that acts during time tis called impulse given by

$$
\text { Impulse }=\mathrm{F} \times t=m \mathrm{v}_{1}-m \mathrm{v}_{1}
$$

Example 2.7 A 1500 kg car has its velocity reduced from $20 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{\prime}$ to $15 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{\prime \prime}$ in 3.0 s . How large was the average retarding force?

Solution Using the Eq. (2.27)

$$
\begin{aligned}
& F \times t=m v_{1}-m v_{1} \\
& F \times 3.0 \mathrm{~s}=1500 \mathrm{~kg} \times 15 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{\prime}-1500 \mathrm{~kg} \times 20 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{\prime} \\
& \text { or } \quad \begin{aligned}
F \quad & =-2500 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{2} \\
& =-2500 \mathrm{~N}=-2.5 \mathrm{kN}
\end{aligned}
\end{aligned}
$$

The negative sign indicates that the force is retarding one.

## Law of Conservation of Momentum

Let us consider an isolated system. It is a system on which no external agency exerts any force. For example, the molecules of a gas enclosed in a glass vessel at constant temperature constitute an isolated system. The molecules can collide with one another because of their random motion, but being enclosed by glass vessel, no external agency can exert a force on them.
Consider an isolated system of two smooth hard interacting balls of masses $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$, moving along the same straight line, in the same direction, with velocities $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ respectively. Both the balls collide and after collision, ball of mass $m_{1}$ moves with velocity $v_{1}$ vand $m_{2}$ moves with velocity $v_{2}^{\prime}$ in the same direction as shown in Fig. (2.9).
To find the change in momentum of mass $m_{1}$.
Using Eq. (2.27) as:
[Image removed]
[Image removed]

Fig. 2.9

$$
F \times t=m_{1} v_{1}-m_{1} v_{1}
$$

Similarly, for the ball of mass $m_{2}$, we have

$$
F^{\prime} \times t=m_{2} v_{2}^{\prime}-m_{2} v_{2}
$$

Adding these two expressions, we have

$$
\left(F+F^{\prime}\right) t=\left(m_{1} v_{1}^{\prime}-m_{1} v_{1}\right)+\left(m_{2} v_{2}^{\prime}-m_{2} v_{2}\right)
$$

Since the action force $F$ is equal and opposite to the reaction force $F^{\prime}$, we have $F^{\prime}=-F$, or $F+F^{\prime}=0$ so the left hand side of the equation is zero. Hence,

$$
0=\left(m_{1} v_{1}^{\prime}-m_{1} v_{1}\right)+\left(m_{2} v_{2}^{\prime}-m_{2} v_{2}\right)
$$

In other words, change in momentum of 1st ball + change in momentum of the $2^{\text {nd }}$ ball is zero.
or $\left(m_{1} v_{1}+m_{2} v_{2}\right)=\left(m_{1} v_{1}^{\prime}+m_{2} v_{2}^{\prime}\right)$

When a moving car stops quickly, the passengers move forward towards the windshield. Beatbelts change the forces of motion and prevent the passengers from moving. Thus, the chance of injury is greatly reduced.

Which means that total initial momentum of the system before collision is equal to the total final momentum of the system after collision. Consequently, the total change in momentum of the isolated two ball system is zero.
For such a group of objects, if one object within the group experiences a force, there must exist an equal but opposite reaction force on other object in the same group. As a result, the change in momentum of the group of objects as a whole is always zero. This can be expressed in the form of law of conservation of momentum, which states that:

The total linear momentum of an isolated system remains constant.
In applying the conservation law, we must notice that the momentum of a body is a vector quantity.

Example 2.8 Two spherical balls of 2.0 kg and 3.0 kg masses are moving towards each other with velocities of $6.0 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ and $4 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$, respectively. What must be the velocity of the smaller ball after collision, if the velocity of the bigger ball is $3.0 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ ?

Solution As both the balls are moving towards one another, so their velocities are of opposite sign. Let us suppose that the direction of motion of 2 kg ball is positive and that of the 3 kg is negative.
The momentum of the system before collision is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
m_{1} v_{1}+m_{2} v_{2} & =2 \mathrm{~kg} \times 8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}+3 \mathrm{~kg} \times\left(-4 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\right) \\
& =12 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}-12 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}=0
\end{aligned}
$$

A motorcycle's safety helmet is padded so as to extend the time of any collision to prevent serious injury.

Momentum of the system after collision $=m_{1} v_{1}+m_{2} v_{2}^{\prime}$

$$
=2 \mathrm{~kg} \times v_{1}^{\prime}+3 \mathrm{~kg} \times(-3) \mathrm{m} \mathrm{~s}^{\prime}
$$

From the law of conservation of momentum

# 2.8 ELASTIC AND INELASTIC COLLISIONS 

When a tennis ball is dropped on the floor vertically, it may not rebound to its initial height. It is because, a portion of $K . E$. is lost, partly due to friction as the molecules in the ball move past one another when the ball distorts and partly due to its change into heat and sound energies. Similar is the case when two tennis balls collide with certain velocities, their final kinetic energy may be less than the total initial kinetic energy.

A collision in which the K.E. of the system is not conserved, is called inelastic collision.

Under certain special conditions, no kinetic energy is lost in the collision or impact on hitting the floor. Such type of collision is said to be elastic collision.

For example, when a hard ball is dropped onto a marble floor, it rebounds to very nearly the initial height. It loses negligible amount of energy in the collision with the floor. It is to be noted that momentum and total energy are conserved in all types of collisions. However, the K.E. is conserved only if it is an elastic collision.

## Elastic Collisions in One Dimension

Consider two smooth, non-rotating balls of masses $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ moving initially with velocities $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ respectively, in the same direction. They collide and after collision, they move along the same straight line without rotation. Let their velocities after the collision be $\mathbf{v}^{\prime}$, and $\mathbf{v}_{2}^{\prime}$ respectively, as
[Image removed]

Before collision shown in Fig.(2.10).
We take the positive direction of the velocity and momentum to the right. By applying the law of conservation of momentum we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \left(m_{1} v_{1}+m_{2} v_{2}\right)=\left(m_{1} v_{1}+m_{2} v_{2}\right) \\
& m_{1}\left(v_{1}-v_{1}^{\prime}\right)=m_{2}\left(v_{2}^{\prime}-v_{2}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

[Image removed]

Fig. 2.10

As the collision is elastic, so the K.E. is conserved. From the conservation of K.E.,

# Physica II 

we have

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\frac{1}{2} m_{1} v_{1}^{2}+\frac{1}{2} m_{2} v_{2}^{2} & =\frac{1}{2} m_{1} v_{1}^{2}+\frac{1}{2} m_{2} v_{2}^{2} \\
m_{1}\left(v_{1}^{2}-v_{1}^{2}\right) & =m_{2}\left(v_{2}^{2}-v_{2}^{2}\right) \\
m_{1}\left(v_{1}+v_{1}^{\prime}\right)\left(v_{1}-v_{1}^{\prime}\right)=m_{2}\left(v_{2}^{\prime}+v_{2}\right)\left(v_{2}^{\prime}-v_{2}\right) & \ldots \ldots . .(2.30)
\end{array}
$$

Dividing Eq. (2.29) by (2.30)

$$
\begin{aligned}
\left(v_{1}+v_{1}^{\prime}\right) & =\left(v_{2}^{\prime}+v_{2}\right) \\
\left(v_{1}-v_{2}\right) & =\left(v_{2}^{\prime}-v_{1}^{\prime}\right)=-\left(v_{1}^{\prime}-v_{2}^{\prime}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

We note that, before collision $\left(v_{1}-v_{2}\right)$ is the velocity of first ball relative to the second ball. Similarly $\left(v_{1}^{\prime}-v_{2}^{\prime}\right)$ is the velocity of the first ball relative to the second ball after collision. It means that relative velocities before and after the collision has the same magnitude but are reversed after the collision. In other words, the magnitude of relative velocity of approach is equal to the magnitude of relative velocity of separation.
In equations (2.29) and (2.30) $m_{1}, m_{2}, v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ are known quantities. We solve these equations to find the values of $v_{1}^{\prime}$ and $v_{2}^{\prime}$ which are unknown. The results are

$$
\begin{aligned}
& v_{1}^{\prime}=\frac{m_{1}-m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} v_{1}^{\prime}+\frac{2 m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} v_{2} \\
& v_{2}^{\prime}=\frac{2 m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} v_{1}^{\prime}+\frac{m_{2}-m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} v_{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

[Image removed]

Before collision
There are some cases of special interest, which are discussed below:
(i) When $m_{1}=m_{2}$

From Eq. (2.32) and (2.33), we find that
and

$$
\begin{aligned}
& v_{1}^{\prime}=v_{2} \\
& v_{2}^{\prime}=v_{1}
\end{aligned}
$$

(as shown in Fig. 2.11)
(ii) When $m_{1}=m_{2}$ and $v_{2}=0$

In this case, the mass $m_{1}$ be at rest, and $v_{2}=0$, then Eqs. (2.32) and (2.33) give

$$
v_{1}^{\prime}=0 ; \quad v_{2}^{\prime}=v_{1}
$$

When $m_{1}=m_{2}$ then ball of mass $m_{1}$ after collision will come to a stop and $m_{2}$ will take off with the velocity that $m_{1}$ originally had, as shown in Fig.(2.12). Thus when a billiard ball $m_{1}$, moving on
[Image removed]

case (II)
[Image removed]

Before collision
[Image removed]

Fig. 2.12

a table collides with exactly similar ball $m_{2}$ at rest, the ball $m_{1}$ stops while $m_{2}$ begins to move with the same velocity, with which $m_{1}$ was moving initially.
(iii) When a light body collides with a massive body at rest
In this case initial velocity $v_{2}=0$ and $m_{2} \gg>m_{1}$. Under these conditions $m_{1}$ can be neglected as compared to $m_{2}$. From Eq. (2.33) and (2.32), we have $v_{1}^{\prime}=-v_{1}$ and $v_{2}^{\prime}=0$.
The result is shown in Fig.(2.13). This means that $m_{1}$ will bounce back with the same velocity while $m_{2}$ will remain stationary. This fact is used of by the squash player.
(iv) When a massive body collides with light stationary body
In this case, $m_{1} \gg>m_{2}$ and $v_{2}=0$, so $m_{2}$ can be neglected in Eqs.(2.32) and (2.33). This gives $v_{1}^{\prime} \approx v_{1}$ and $v_{2}^{\prime} \approx 2 v_{1}$. Thus, after the collision, there is practically no change in the velocity of massive body, but the lighter one bounces off in the forward direction with approximately twice the velocity of the incident body, as shown in Fig.(2.14).

# 2.9 INELASTIC COLLISION IN ONE DIMENSION 

Consider two bodies having masses $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$, moving with velocities $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$, along the same line such that $v_{1}>v_{2}$. In such a case $m_{1}$ is regarded as projectile and $m_{2}$ as target. After time $t$ both the bodies make inelastic collision and stick together. Let their combined mass become $m_{1} \pm m_{2}$ which moves with final velocity $v_{1}$ after collision.
[Image removed]

Since the collision is perfectly inelastic, the total momentum of balls is conserved. Using law of conservation of momentum.
Total momentum of system before collision = Total momentum of the system after collision

$$
\begin{gathered}
m_{1} v_{1}+m_{2} v_{2}=\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\right) v_{1} \\
v_{1}=\frac{m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} v_{1}+\frac{m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} v_{2}
\end{gathered}
$$

Which gives the common velocity of the body after inelastic collision.

In a special case when the target $m_{2}$ is at rest, $v_{2}=0$, the above equation becomes:

$$
v_{1}=\begin{gathered}
m_{1} \\
m_{1}+m_{2}
\end{gathered}
$$

It shows that velocity of $m_{1}$ is reduced by the mass ratio i.e., $\frac{m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}$.

Example 2.9 A 70 g ball collides with another ball of mass 140 g . The initial velocity of the first ball is $9 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ to the right while the second ball is at rest. If the collision were perfectly elastic. What would be the velocity of the two balls after the collision?

Solution

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
m_{1}=70 \mathrm{~g} & v_{1}=9 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1} \\
m_{2}=140 \mathrm{~g} & v_{1}^{\prime}=? \\
v_{2}^{\prime}=?
\end{array}
$$

We know that:

$$
\begin{aligned}
v_{1}^{\prime} & =\frac{m_{1}-m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} v_{1} \\
& =\left(\frac{70 \mathrm{~g}-140 \mathrm{~g}}{70 \mathrm{~g}+140 \mathrm{~g}}\right) \times 9 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}=-3 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\
v_{2}^{\prime} & =\frac{2 m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} v_{1} \\
& =\left(\frac{2 \times 70 \mathrm{~g}}{70 \mathrm{~g}+140 \mathrm{~g}}\right) \times 9 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1} \\
& =6 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

# 2.10 ELASTIC COLLISION IN TWO DIMENSIONS 

Consider the motion of two balls of mass $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ in a straight line with velocities $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ respectively undergoing an elastic collision with each other as shown in Fig. 2.18
Assume the bodies move off in different directions after collision with velocities $v^{\prime}$, and $v_{2}^{\prime}$ making angles 0 . and $0_{2}$ respectively with $x$-axis.
[Image removed]

Fig. 2.16

As, the collision is elastic, so we apply both the laws of conservation of momentum and law of conservation of kinetic energy. Momentum is a vector quantity, we resolve it into its rectangular components and apply the law of conservation of momentum along both axes.

# Momentum conservation along $x$-axis is: 

Momentum before collision $=$ momentum after collision

$$
m_{1} v_{1}+m_{1} v_{2}=m_{1} v_{1}^{\prime} \cos \theta_{1}+m_{1} v_{1}^{\prime} \cos \theta_{2}
$$

Momentum conservation along $y$-axis:
Momentum before collision $=$ Momentum after collision

$$
0=m_{1} v_{1}^{\prime} \sin \theta_{1}-m_{1} v_{2}^{\prime} \sin \theta_{2}
$$

## Conservation of Energy

Kinetic Energy before collision = Kinetic Energy after collision

$$
\frac{1}{2} m_{1} v_{1}^{2}+\frac{1}{2} m_{2} v_{2}^{2}=\frac{1}{2} m_{1} v_{1}^{2}+\frac{1}{2} m_{2} v_{2}^{2}
$$

These equations ( 2.35 to 2.37 ) are useful in solving problems about elastic collisions in two dimensions.

### 2.11 INELASTIC COLLISION IN TWO DIMENSIONS

The macroscopic collisions are generally inelastic and do not conserve Kinetic energy.
The perfect inelastic collision is one in which the colliding objects stick together to make a single mass after collision. Its analysis can be carried out as follows:
Let us take two balls having masses $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ moving with velocities, $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$, respectively, in a two-dimensional $x y$ plane. Assume that the first body is moving along the $x$-axis while the second body moves in a direction, making an angle $\theta$ with $x$-axis. Both the bodies collide at the origin as shown in the figure 2.17 .
[Image removed]

Fig. 2.17

After collision, bodies stick together, having combined mass $M=m_{1}+m_{2}$, which moves with velocity $v_{1}$, making an angle $\phi$ with $x$-axis.

## Momentum in the $x$-direction:

$$
m_{1} v_{1}+m_{2} v_{2} \cos \theta=M v_{1} \cos \phi
$$

Momentum in the $y$-direction:

$$
0+m_{2} v_{2} \sin \theta=M v_{1} \sin \phi
$$

Equation 2.38 and 2.39 can be used to find the final velocity.

## Kinetic Energy

Since collision is inelastic, the kinetic energy of colliding system is not conserved. The loss of kinetic energy is computed as follows:

# Initial Kinetic Energy 

The total initial kinetic energy $K . E_{i}$ of the system before the collision is:

$$
(K . E)_{t}=\frac{1}{2} m_{1} v_{1}^{2}+\frac{1}{2} m_{2} v_{2}^{2}
$$

Since $K . E$. is a scalar quantity, so velocities involving in the formula of $K . E$. does not require to break velocities into their components.

## Final Kinetic Energy

The total final kinetic energy $K . E_{t}$ after the collision (when the objects stick together) is:

$$
(K . E)_{t}=\frac{1}{2} M v_{t}^{2}
$$

where $v_{t}$ is magnitude of the final velocity which can be calculated from Eq. (2.41).

## Energy Loss in the Collision

Since the collision is inelastic, there is a loss in kinetic energy, represented by $\Delta K . E$.

$$
\Delta K . E_{i}=(K . E)_{t}-(K . E)_{t}
$$

This lost kinetic energy is transformed into other forms of energy, such as heat, sound, or in deformation.

## Some examples of an inelastic collision:

(i) When a karate chop breaks a pile of bricks, it's an example of an inelastic collision. In this type of collision, the objects involved don't bounce back after impact. Instead, some of the energy from the strike is absorbed by the bricks, converting into heat, sound, and the force needed to break them. This means the energy goes into breaking the bricks rather than causing the hand to rebound. If the Karate chop is not perfectly vertical and involves some horizontal motion, the momentum transfer and the resulting forces will have both horizontal and vertical components.
(ii) In a car crash, the collision is an inelastic nature. When the vehicles collide and absorb the impact energy, causing them to crumple and deform. This energy absorption slows down the cars, stopping them from bouncing back. Most of the kinetic energy is lost, turning into heat, sound, and damage to the vehicles.
(iii) In real-world collisions, a ball and bat show an inelastic behaviour. When the bat hits the ball, some of the kinetic energy is lost because the ball deforms, and energy is also converted into heat and sound. Even though the bat is rigid, it does not transfer energy perfectly and absorbs some energy itself. The ball compresses upon impact, which leads to further energy loss. Consequently, not all of the initial kinetic energy is conserved, making the collision overall an inelastic.

# 2.12 ROCKET PROPULSION 

Rockets move by expelling burning gas through engines at their rear. The ignited fuel turns to a high pressure gas which is expelled with extremely high velocity from the rocket engines (Fig. 2.18). The rocket gains momentum equal to the momentum of the gas expelled from the engine but in opposite direction. The rocket engines continue to expel gases after the rocket has begun moving and hence rocket continues to gain more and more momentum. So, instead of travelling at steady speed the rocket gets faster and faster so long the engines are operating.
A rocket carries its own fuel in the form of a liquid or solid hydrogen and oxygen. It can, therefore work at great heights where very little or no air is present. In order to provide enough upward thrust to overcome gravity, a typical rocket consumes about $10000 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~s}^{\prime \prime}$ of fuel and ejects the burnt gases at speeds of over $4000 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{\prime \prime}$. In fact, more than $80 \%$ of the launch mass of a rocket consists of fuel only. One way to overcome the problem of mass of fuel is to make the rocket from several rockets linked together.
When one rocket has done its job, it is discarded leaving others to carry the space cratt further up at ever greater speed.
If $m$ is the mass of the gases ejected per second with velocity $v$ relative to the rocket, the change in momentum per second of the ejecting gases is mv. This equals the thrust produced by the engine on the body of the rocket. So, the acceleration 'a' of the rocket is

$$
a=\frac{m v}{M} \ldots \ldots(2.42)
$$

where $M$ is the mass of the rocket. When the fuel in the rocket is burned and ejected, the mass $M$ of rocket decreases and hence the acceleration increases.
[Image removed]

Fuel and oxygen mix in the combustion chamber. Hot gases exhaust the chamber at a very high velocity. The gain in momentum of the gases equals the gain in momentum of the rocket. The gas and rocket push against each other and move in opposite directions.

Among all possible motions of the material bodies, the circular motion is one that appears to be working in the most of the natural world. Satellites moving in circular orbits around the Earth, orbital and spin motion of the Earth itself, a car turning around a curved road, and a stone whirled around by a string are the familiar examples. When objects move in circular paths, their direction is continuously changing. Since velocity is a vector quantity, this change of direction means that their velocities are not constant. In this chapter, we will study, circular motion, rotational motion, moment of inertia, angular momentum and the related topics.

# 3.1 ANGULAR MEASUREMENTS 

Consider an angle subtended at the centre ' $O$ ' of a circle by an arc 'AB' as shown in Fig. 3.1. If the length of the arc 'AB' is equal to the radius $r$ ' of the circle, then the angle is called one radian. It is the SI unit of angular measurement and its symbol is "rad".

## Angular Displacement

Fig. 3.1

Consider the motion of a single particle $P$ of mass $m$ in a circular path of radius $r$. Suppose this motion is taking place by attaching the particle $P$ at the end of a massless rigid rod of length $r$ whose other end is pivoted at the centre $O$ of the circular path, as shown in Fig. 3.2 (a). As the particle is moving on the circular path, the rod OP rotates in the plane of the circle. The axis of rotation passes through the pivot $O$ and is normal to the plane of rotation. Consider a system of axes as shown in Fig. 3.2 (b). The z-axis is taken along the axis of rotation with the pivot $O$ as origin of coordinates. Axes $x$ and $y$ are taken in the plane of rotation. While OP is rotating, suppose at any instant $t$, its position is $\mathrm{OP}_{1}$, making angle $\theta$ with $x$-axis. At a later time $t+\Delta t$, let its position be $\mathrm{OP}_{2}$ making angle $\theta+\Delta \theta$ with $x$-axis (Fig. 3.2-c).

Fig. 3.2(c)

Angle $\Delta \theta$ defines the angular displacement of $O P$ during the time interval $\Delta t$. For very small values of $\Delta \theta$, the angular displacement is a vector quantity.

The angular displacement $\Delta \theta$ is assigned a positive sign when the sense of rotation of OP is counter clock wise.
The direction associated with $\Delta \theta$ is along the axis of rotation and is given by right hand rule as shown in Fig 3.2 (d) which states that:

Grasp the axis of rotation in right hand with fingers curling in the direction of rotation; the thumb points in the direction of angular displacement.
[Image removed]

Fig. 3.2(d)

Three units are generally used to express angular displacement, namely degrees, revolution and radian. Consider an arc of length $S$ of a circle of radius $r$ (Fig. 3.3) which subtends an angle $\theta$ at the centre of the circle. Its value in radians (rad) is given as:

$$
\theta=\frac{S}{r}
$$

or

$$
S=r \theta \quad \text { (where } \theta \text { is in radian) }
$$

If OP is rotating, the point $P$ covers a distance $S=2 \pi r$ in one revolution of $P$. In radian, it would be:

$$
\frac{S}{r}-\frac{2 \pi r}{r}-2 \pi
$$

So

$$
1 \text { revolution }=2 \pi \mathrm{rad}=360^{\circ}
$$

$$
\text { or } \quad 1 \mathrm{rad}=\frac{360^{\circ}}{2 \pi}=57.3^{\circ}
$$

# Angular Velocity 

Very often, we are interested in knowing how fast or how slow a body is rotating. It is determined by its angular velocity defined as the rate at which the angular displacement is changing with time. Referring to Fig. 3.2(c), if $\Delta \theta$ is the angular displacement during the time interval $\Delta t$, the average angular velocity $\omega_{0}$ during this interval is given by

$$
\omega_{0 r}=\frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t}
$$

The instantaneous angular velocity $\omega$ is the limit of the ratio $\Delta \theta / \Delta t$ as $\Delta t$, approaches to zero.

$$
\text { Thus } \quad \omega=\lim _{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t}
$$

In the limit when $\Delta t$ approaches zero, the angular displacement would be infinitesimally small. So, it would be a vector quantity and the angular velocity as defined by Eq. 3.3 would also be a vector. Its direction is along the axis of rotation and is given by right hand rule as described earlier.

Angular velocity is measured in radians per second which is the SI unit. Sometimes it is also given in terms of revolution per minute (rpm).

## Angular acceleration

When we switch on an electric fan, we notice that its angular velocity goes on increasing till it becomes uniform. We say that it has an angular acceleration. We define angular acceleration as the rate of change of angular velocity. If $\omega_{1}$ and $\omega_{1}$ are the values of instantaneous velocity of a rotating body at instants $t_{1}$ and $t_{r}$, the average angular acceleration during the interval $t_{1}-t_{1}$ is given by

$$
\alpha_{0 r}=\frac{\omega_{r}-\omega_{1}}{t_{r}-t_{1}}=\frac{\Delta \omega}{\Delta t}
$$

The instantaneous angular acceleration is the limit of the ratio $\frac{\Delta \omega}{\Delta t}$ as $\Delta t$ approaches zero. Therefore, instantaneous angular acceleration $\alpha$ is given by

$$
\alpha=\lim _{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \frac{\Delta \omega}{\Delta t}
$$

The angular acceleration is also a vector quantity whose magnitude is given by Eq. 3.5 and its direction is along the axis of rotation. Angular acceleration is expressed in rads ${ }^{2}$.
Till now we have been considering the motion of a particle $P$ on a circular path. The point $P$ was fixed at the end of a rotating massless rigid rod. Now consider the rotation of a rigid body as shown in Fig. 3.4. Imagine a point $P$ on the rigid body. Line $O P$ is the perpendicular dropped from $P$ on the axis of rotation usually referred as the reference line. As the body rotates, line OP also rotates with the same angular velocity and angular acceleration. Thus, the rotation of a rigid body can be described by the rotation of the reference line OP and all the terms that we defined with the help of rotating line OP are also valid for the rotational motion of a rigid body. Henceforth, while dealing with rotation of a rigid body, we will replace it by its reference line OP.

# Relation between Angular and Linear Velocities 

Consider a rigid body rotating about $z$-axis with an angular velocity $\omega$ as shown in Fig. 3.5 (a).
Imagine a point $P$ in the rigid body af a perpendicular distance $r$ from the axis of rotation. OP represents the reference line of the rigid body. As the body rotates, the point $P$ moves along a circle of radius $r$ with a linear velocity $v$ whereas the line OP rotates with angular velocity $\omega$ as shown in Fig. 3.5 (b). We are interested in finding out the relation between $\omega$ and $v$. As the axis of rotation is fixed, so the direction of $\omega$ always remains the same and $\omega$ can be manipulated as a scalar. As regards the linear velocity of the point $P$, let us consider only its magnitude only which can also be treated as a scalar.

$$
P_{1} P_{2}=\Delta S
$$

Suppose during the course of its motion, the point $P$ moves through a distance $P_{1} P_{2}=\Delta S$ in a time interval $\Delta t$ during which reference line OP covers an angular displacement $\Lambda 0$ radian. So, $\Lambda S$ and $\Lambda 0$ are related by Eq. 3.1 as:

$$
\Delta S=r \Delta 0
$$

[Image removed]

Fig. 3.4
[Image removed]

Fig. 3.5(b)
[Image removed]

As the wheel turns through an angle $\theta$, it lays out a tangential distance $S=r \theta$.

Dividing both sides by $\Delta t$

$$
\frac{\Delta S}{\Delta t}=r \frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t}
$$

In the limit when linear $\Delta t \rightarrow 0$ the ratio $\Delta S / \Delta t$ represents $v$, the magnitude of the linear velocity with which point $P$ is moving on the circumference of the circle. Similarly $\Delta \theta / \Delta t$ represents the angular velocity $\omega$ of the reference line OP So. Eq. 3.6 becomes:

$$
v=r \omega
$$

From Fig. 3.5(b), it can be seen that the point $P$ is moving along the arc $\mathrm{P}_{1} \mathrm{P}_{2}$. In the limit when $\Delta t \rightarrow 0$, the length of arc $\mathrm{P}_{1} \mathrm{P}_{2}$ becomes very small and its direction represents the direction of tangent to the circle at point $P_{1}$. Thus, the velocity with which point $P$ is moving on the circumference of the circle has a magnitude $v$ and its direction is always along the tangent to the circle at that point. That is why the linear velocity of the point $P$ is also known as tangential velocity.
Similarly, Eq. 3.7 shows that if the reference line OP is rotating with an angular acceleration $\alpha$, the point $P$ will also have a linear or tangential acceleration $a_{r}$. Using Eq. 3.7 it can be shown that the two accelerations are related by

$$
a_{1}=r \alpha
$$

Eqs. 3.7 and 3.8 show that on a rotating body, points that are at different distances from the axis do not have the same speed or acceleration, but all points on a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis do have the same angular displacement, angular speed and angular acceleration at any instant. Thus, by the use of angular variables, we can describe the motion of the entire body in a simple way.

# Equations of Angular Motion 

The equations $(3.2,3.3,3.4$ and 3.5 ) of angular motion are exactly analogous to those in linear motion if $0, \omega$ and $\alpha$ be replaced by $S, v$ and $a$, respectively. As the other equations of linear motion were obtained by algebraic manipulation of these equations, it follows that analogous equations will also apply to angular motion. Given below are angular equations together with their linear counterparts.

| Linear Equations | Angular Equations |
| :--: | :--: |
| $v_{t}=v_{t}+a t$ | $\omega_{t}=\omega_{t}+\alpha t$ |
| $2 a S=v_{t}^{2}-v_{t}^{2}$ | $2 \alpha \theta=\omega_{t}^{2}-\omega_{t}^{2}$ |
| $S=v_{t} t+\frac{1}{2} a t^{2}$ | $\theta=\omega_{t} t+\frac{1}{2} \alpha t^{2}$ |

The angular equations 3.9 to 3.11 hold true only in the case when the axis of rotation is fixed, so that all the angular vectors have the same direction. Hence, they can be manipulated as scalars.

Example 3.1 An electric fan rotating at 3 rev s" is switched off. It comes to rest in 18.0 s . Assuming deceleration to be uniform, find its value. How many revolutions did it tum before coming to rest?

Solution In this problem, we have
$\omega_{t}=3.0 \mathrm{rev} \mathrm{s}^{-1}, \quad \omega_{t}=0, \quad t=18.0 \mathrm{~s}$ and $\alpha=?, \quad \theta=$ ?
From Eq. 3.9, we have

$$
\alpha=\frac{\omega_{r}-\omega_{t}}{t}=\frac{(0-3.0) \mathrm{revs}^{-1}}{18.0 \mathrm{~s}}=-0.167 \mathrm{rev} \mathrm{~s}^{2}
$$

and from Eq 3.11, we have

$$
0=\omega_{t} t+\frac{1}{2} \alpha t^{2}
$$

$=3.0 \mathrm{rev} \mathrm{s}^{-1} \times 18.0 \mathrm{~s}+\frac{1}{2}\left(-0.167 \mathrm{rev} \mathrm{s}^{-2}\right) \times(18.0 \mathrm{~s})^{2}$
$=27$ rev

Direction of motion changes continuously in circular motion.

# 3.2 CENTRIPETAL FORCE 

Newton's second law of motion states that when a force acts on a body, it produces acceleration in the same direction. A force acting on a moving body along the direction of its velocity will change magnitude of the velocity (speed) keeping the direction unchanged. On the other hand, a constant force acting perpendicular to the velocity of a body moving in a circular path will change the direction but magnitude of velocity (speed) will remain the same. Such force makes the body move in a circle by producing a radial (or centripetal) acceleration and is called centripetal force (Centre seeking) force. Figure 3.6(a) shows a ball tied at the end of a string is whirled in a horizontal surface. It would not continue in a circular path if the string is snapped. Careful observation shows at once that if the string snaps, when the ball is at the point $A$, in Fig. 3.6 (b), the ball will follow the
[Image removed]

Fig. $3.6(a)$
[Image removed]

Fig. $3.6(b)$
straight line path $A B$ which is tangent $A B$ at point $A$.
Thus, a force is needed to change the direction of velocity or motion of a body continuously at each point in circular motion moving with uniform speed. The force that does not alter speed but only direction at each point is a perpendicular force which acts along the radius of the circular path. This force always pulls the object towards the centre

of the circular path. Its direction is perpendicular to the tangential velocity at each point.
The force needed to bend the straight path of the particle into a circular path is called the centripetal force.
For a body of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v$ in a circular path of radius $r$, centripetal force $F_{c}$ is given by

$$
F_{c}=m u_{c}=\frac{m v^{2}}{r}
$$

where $a=v^{2} / r$ is the centripetal acceleration and its direction is towards the centre of the circle. As $v=r \omega$, so the above equation becomes:

$$
F_{c}=m r \omega^{2}
$$

Example 3.2 If a CD spins at 210 rpm , what is the radial acceleration of a point on the outer rim of the CD? The CD is 12 cm in diameter.
Solution We convert 210 rpm into a frequency in revolutions per second $(\mathrm{Hz})$.
Thus $f=210 \frac{\mathrm{rev}}{\min } \times \frac{1}{60} \frac{\min }{s}=3.5 \frac{\mathrm{rev}}{\mathrm{s}}=3.5 \mathrm{~Hz}$
For each revolution, the CD rotates through an angle of $2 \pi$ radians. The angular velocity is:

$$
\omega=2 \pi f=2 \pi \mathrm{rad} \times 3.5 \mathrm{~s}^{-1}=7.0 \pi \mathrm{rad} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}
$$

The radial acceleration is:

$$
a=\omega^{2} r=\left(7.0 \pi \mathrm{rad} \mathrm{~s}^{1}\right)^{2} \times 0.06 \mathrm{~m}=29 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}
$$

Example 2.3 A ball tied to the end of a string, is swung in a vertical circle of radius $r$ under the action of gravity as shown in Fig. 3.7. What will be the tension in the string when the ball is at the point $A$ of the path and its speed is $v$ at this point?
Solution For the ball to travel in a circle, the force acting on the ball must provide the required centripetal force. In this case, at point $A$, two forces act on the ball, the pull of the string and the weight $w$ of the ball. These forces act along the radius at $A$, and so their vector sum must furnish the required centripetal force. We, therefore, have

$$
\begin{aligned}
& T+w=\frac{m v^{2}}{r} \quad \text { as } w=m g \text {, therefore. } \\
& \therefore \quad T=\frac{m v^{2}}{r}-m g=m\left(\frac{v^{2}}{r}-g\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Curved flight at high speed requires a large centripetal force that makes the stunt dangerous even if the air planes are not so close.
[Image removed]

Fig. 3.7

If $\frac{v^{2}}{r}=g$, then $T$ will be zero and the centripetal force is just equal to the weight.

# Examples of centripetal force 

In every circular or orbital motion, centripetal force is needed which is provided by some agency.

1. When a ball is whirled in a horizontal circle with the help of a string, then tension in the string provides necessary centripetal force.
2. For an object placed on a turntable, the friction is the centripetal force.
3. The gravitational force is the cause of the Earth orbiting around the Sun, Moon and artificial satellites revolving around the Earth.
4. A normal or perpendicular magnetic force compels a charge particle moving along a straight path into a circular path.
5. When a vehicle takes turn on a road, it also needs centripetal force which is provided by the friction between the tyres and the road. If the road is slippery, then at high speed, the friction may not be sufficient enough to provided necessary centripetal force.
[Image removed]

Banked tracks are needed for turns that are taken so quickly that friction alone cannot provide energy for centripetal force

Hence, vehicle will not be able to take turn and may skid or may even be toppled. To overcome this difficulty, the highway road is banked on turns. That is, the outer edge of the track is kept slightly higher than that of the inner edge.

## Applications of Centripetal Force

We know that an object moves in a circle because of centripetal force. If the magnitude of applied force falls short of required centripetal force then the object will move away from the centre of the circle. The centrifuge (Fig. 3.8-a) functions on this basic principle.
Centrifuge: It is one of the most useful laboratory device. It helps to separate out denser and lighter particles from a mixture. The mixture is rotated at high speed for a specific time. In a laboratory setup, sample tubes are used where the denser particles will settle at the bottom and lighter particles will rise to the top of the sample tubes (Fig. 3.8-b).
The dryer of the washing machine also functions on the principle of centrifuge. The dryer consists of a long cylinder with hundreds of small holes on its wall. Wet clothes are piled up in this cylinder, which is then rotated rapidly about its axis. Water moves outward to the walls of the cylinder and thus, drained out through the holes. In this way, clothes become dry quickly.
[Image removed]

Cream separator is another practical device which is used to separate cream form the milk. In this machine, milk is whirled rapidly. Since milk is a mixture of light and heavy particles, when it is rotated, the light particles gather near the axis of rotation whereas the heavy particles will go outwards and hence, cream can easily be separated from milk.

# 3.3 ARTIFICIAL SATELLITES 

Satellites are objects that orbit in nearly circular path around the Earth. They are put into orbit by rockets and are
[Image removed]

Fig. 3.10
held in orbits by the gravitational pull of the Earth. The low flying Earth satellites have acceleration $9.8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{2}$ towards the centre of the Earth. If there is no gravitational pull, they would fly off in a straight line along tangent to the orbit. When the satellite is moving in a circle, it has an acceleration $\vec{v}$. In a circular orbit around the Earth, the centripetal acceleration is supplied by gravity and we have

$$
g=\frac{v^{2}}{R}
$$

(3.14)
where $v$ is the orbital velocity and $R$ is the radius of the Earth $(6400 \mathrm{~km})$. From Eq. 3.14, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
v & =\sqrt{g R} \\
& -\sqrt{9.5 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{2} \times 6.4 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~m}} \\
& =7.9 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}=7.9 \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~s}^{1}
\end{aligned}
$$

This is the minimum velocity necessary to put a satellite into the orbit, called the critical velocity. The period $T$ is given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
T & =\frac{2 \pi R}{v}=2 \times 3.14 \times \frac{6400 \mathrm{~km}}{7.9 \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~s}^{1}} \\
& =5060 \mathrm{~s}=84 \mathrm{~min} \text { approx. }
\end{aligned}
$$

If, however, a satellite in a circular orbit is at a distance $h$ much greater than $R$ above the Earth's surface, we must take into account the experimental fact that the gravitational acceleration decreases inversely as the square of the distance from the centre of the Earth (Fig.3.11).
The higher the satellite, the slower will be the required speed and longer it will take to complete one revolution around the Earth.
[Image removed]

Fig. 3.11

# Orbital Velocity 

Figure 3.12 shows a satellite going round the Earth in a circular path. Let the mass of the satellite be $m_{s}$ and $v$ is its orbital speed. The mass of the Earth is $M$ and $r$ represents the radius of the orbit. A centripetal force $m_{s} v^{2} / r$ is required to hold the satellite in the orbit. This force is provided by the gravitational force of attraction between the Earth and the satellite. Equating the gravitational force to the required centripetal force, we have

$$
\frac{G m_{s} M}{r^{2}}=\frac{m_{s} v^{2}}{r}
$$

or

$$
v=\sqrt{\frac{G M}{r}}
$$

This shows that the mass of the satellite is unimportant in describing the satellite's orbit. Thus, any satellite orbiting at distance $r$ from the Earth's centre must have the orbital speed given by Eq. 3.15. Any speed less than this will bring the satellite tumbling back to the Earth.

## Example 3.6

An Earth satellite is in circular orbit at distance of $384,000 \mathrm{~km}$ from the Earth's surface. What is its period of one revolution in days? Take mass of the Earth $M=6.0 \times 10^{24} \mathrm{~kg}$ and its radius $R=6400 \mathrm{~km}$.

## Solution

As $\quad r=R+h=(6400+384000) \mathrm{km}=390400 \mathrm{~km}$

Using $v=\sqrt{\frac{G M}{r}}=\sqrt{\frac{6.67 \times 10^{-11} \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~kg}^{-2} \times 6 \times 10^{24} \mathrm{~kg}}{390400 \mathrm{~km}}}$

Also

$$
T=\frac{2 \pi R}{V}=2 \times 3.14 \times 390400 \mathrm{~km} \times \frac{1}{1.025 \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~s}^{1}} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{day}}{60 \times 60 \times 24 \mathrm{~s}}
$$

## Weightlessness in Satellites

When a satellite is launched by a rocket in its desired orbit around the Earth, then it has been observed practically that everything inside the satellite experiences weightlessness because the satellite is accelerating towards the centre of the Earth as a freely falling body.

In 1984, at a height of 100 km above Hawaii Island with a speed of $29000 \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~h}^{1}$ Bruce McCandless stepped into space from a space shuttle and became the first human satellite of the Earth.

## Do you know?

Your weight slightly changes when the velocity of the elevator changes at the start and end of a ride, not during the rest of the ride when that velocity is constant.

Consider a satellite of mass $M$ revolving in its orbit of radius $r$ around the Earth. A body of mass $m$ inside the satellite suspended by a spring balance from the ceiling of the satellite is under the action of two forces. That is, its weight mg acting downward, while the supporting force, called normal force $F_{n}$ or tension in the spring acting upward, as shown in Fig. 3.13. Their resultant force is equal to the centripetal force required by the mass $m$ which is acting towards the centre of the Earth, and is expressed as:

$$
F_{c}=m g-F_{n}
$$

where

$$
F_{c}=\frac{m v^{2}}{r}
$$

Hence

$$
\frac{m v^{2}}{r}=m g-F_{n}
$$

It may be noted that the centripetal force responsible for the revolution of the satellite of mass $M$ around the Earth is provided by the gravitational force of attraction between the Earth and the satellite.

$$
\begin{aligned}
F_{g} & =F_{n} \\
M g & =\frac{M v^{2}}{r} \\
g & =\frac{v^{2}}{r}
\end{aligned}
$$

Hence, Eq. 3.16(a) becomes:
[Image removed]
or

$$
m g=m g-F_{n}
$$

$$
-F_{n}=0
$$

This shows that the supporting force which is acting on a body inside the satellite is zero. Therefore, the bodies as well as the astronauts in a satellite find themselves in a state of apparent weightlessness.

# Artificial Gravity 

In a gravity free space, there will be no force that will push anybody to any side of the spacecraft. If this spacecraft is to stay in the orbit over an extended period of time, the weightlessness may affect the performance of the astronauts present in that spacecraft. To overcome this difficulty, an artificial gravity can be created in the spacecraft. This could enable the crew of the space ships to function in an almost normal manner. For this situation to prevail, the spaceship is set into rotation around its own axis. The astronaut then is pressed towards the outer rim and exerts a force on the 'floor' of the spaceship in much the same way as on the Earth.
Consider a spacecraft of the shape as shown in Fig. 3.14. The outer radius of the

spaceship is $R$ and it rotates around its own central axis with angular speed $\omega$, then its angular acceleration $a_{c}$ is

$$
a_{c}=R \omega^{2}
$$

But $\omega=\frac{2 \pi}{t}$ where $t$ is the period of revolution of spaceahip
Hence

$$
a_{c}=R \frac{(2 \pi)^{2}}{t^{2}}=R \frac{4 \pi^{2}}{t^{2}}
$$

As frequency $f=1 / t$, therefore,

$$
a_{c}=R 4 \pi^{2} f^{2}
$$

or

$$
f^{2}=\frac{a_{c}}{4 \pi^{2} R} \quad \text { or } \quad f=\frac{1}{2 \pi} \sqrt{\frac{a_{c}}{R}}
$$

As described above, the force of gravity provides the required centripetal acceleration, therefore,

$$
a_{c}=g
$$

So

$$
f=\frac{1}{2 \pi} \sqrt{\frac{g}{R}}
$$

When the spaceship rotates with this frequency, the artificial gravity like the Earth is provided to the inhabitants of the spaceship.

# 3.4 MOMENT OF INERTIA 

Consider a mass $m$ attached to the end of a massless rod as shown in Fig. 3.15. Assume that the bearing at the pivot point $O$ is frictionless. Let the system be in a horizontal plane. A force $F$ is acting on the mass perpendicular to the rod and hence, this will accelerate the mass according to:

$$
F=m a
$$

In doing so, the force will cause the mass to rotate about $O$. Since tangential acceleration $a_{T}$ is related to angular acceleration $\alpha$ by the equation.

$$
a_{1}=r \alpha
$$

So

$$
F=m r \alpha
$$

[Image removed]

The surface of the rotating space-ship pushes on an object with which it is in contact and thereby provides the centripetal force needed to keep the object moving on a circular path.
[Image removed]

Fig. 3.15
The force $F$ causes a torque about the axis $O$ and gives the mass $m$ an angular acceleration $\alpha$ about the pivot point.

As turning effect is produced by torque $\tau$, it would, therefore, be better to write the equation for rotation in terms of torque. This can be done by multiplying both sides of the above equation by $r$. Thus,

$$
r F=\tau=\text { torque }=m r^{2} \alpha
$$

which is rotational analogue of the Newton's second law of motion, $F=m a$.
Here $F$ is replaced by $\tau$, a by $\alpha$ and $m$ by $m r^{2}$. The quantity $m r^{2}$ is known as the moment

of inertia and is represented by $I$. The moment of inertia plays the same role in anguler motion as the mass in linear motion. It may be noted that moment of inertia depends not only on mass $m$ but also on $r^{2}$.
Most rigid bodies have different mass concentration at different distances from the axis of rotation, which means the mass distribution is not uniform. As shown in Fig. 3.16(a), the rigid body is made up of $n$ small pieces of masses $m_{1}, m_{2}, \ldots$ at distances $r_{1}, r_{2}, \ldots$ from the axis of rotation $O$. Let the body be rotating with the angular acceleration $\alpha$, so the magnitude of the torque acting on $m_{1}$ is

$$
\tau_{1}=m_{1} r_{1}^{2} \alpha_{1}
$$

Similarly, the torque on $m_{2}$ is

$$
\tau_{2}=m_{2} r_{2}^{2} \alpha_{2}
$$

[Image removed]

Fig. 3.16
Each small piece of mass within a large, rigid body undergoes the same angular acceleration about the pivot point.
Since the body is rigid, so all the masses are rotating with the same angular acceleration $\alpha$.
Total torque $\tau_{\text {total }}$ is then given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
\tau_{\text {total }} & =\left(m_{1} r_{1}^{2}+m_{2} r_{2}^{2}+\ldots+m_{n} r_{n}^{2}\right) \alpha \\
& =\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} m_{i} r_{i}^{2}\right) \alpha
\end{aligned}
$$

or

$$
\tau=I \alpha
$$

where $I$ is the moment of inertia of the body and is expressed as

$$
I=\sum_{i=1}^{n} m_{i} r_{i}^{2}
$$

# 3.5 ANGULAR MOMENTUM 

We have already seen that linear momentum plays an important role in translational motion of bodies. Similarly, another quantity known as angular momentum has important role in the study of rotational motion.

## A particle is said to possess an angular momentum about a reference axis if it so moves that its angular position changes relative to that reference axis.

The angular momentum $\mathbf{L}$ of a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v$ and momentum $p$ (Fig. 3.17) relative to the origin $O$ is defined as:

$$
L=r x p
$$

where $r$ is the position vector of the particle at that instant relative to the origin $O$. Angular momentum is a vector quantity. Its magnitude is:

$$
L=r p \sin \theta=m r v \sin \theta
$$

where $\theta$ is the angle between $r$ and $p$. The direction of $L$ is perpendicular to the plane formed by $r$ and $p$ and its sense is given by the right hand rule of vector product. SI unit of angular momentum is $\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ or J s .
If the particle is moving in a circle of radius $r$ with uniform angular velocity $\omega$, then angle between $r$ and tangential velocity is $90^{\circ}$. Hence,

$$
L=m r v \sin 90^{\circ}-m r v
$$

But

$$
v=r \omega \quad \text { Hence } \quad L=m r^{2} \omega
$$

Now consider a symmetric rigid body rotating about a fixed axis through the centre of mass as shown in Fig 3.18. Each particle of the rigid body rotates about the same axis in a circle with an angular velocity $\omega$. The magnitude of the angular momentum of the particle of mass $m_{1}$ is $m_{1} v_{1} r_{1}$ about the origin $O$. The direction of $L$ is the same as that of $\omega$. Since $v_{1}=r_{1} \omega$, the angular momentum of the th particle is $m_{1} r_{1}^{2} \omega$. Summing this over all particles gives the total angular momentum of the rigid body.

$$
\mathbf{L}=\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} m_{i} r_{i}^{2}\right) \omega=l \omega
$$

where $l$ is the moment of inertia of the rigid body about the axis of rotation.

The mass of Earth is $6.00 \times 10^{34} \mathrm{~kg}$. The distance $r$ from Earth to the Sun is $1.50 \times 10^{11} \mathrm{~m}$. As seen from the direction of the North Star, the Earth revolves counter-clockwise around the Sun. Determine the orbital angular momentum of the Earth about the Sun, assuming that it traverses a circular orbit about the Sun once a year ( $3.16 \times 10^{\prime}$ s).
Solution To find the Earth's orbital angular momentum, we must first know its orbital speed from the given data. When the Earth moves around a circle of radius $r$, it travels a distance of $2 \pi r$ in one year. Its orbital speed $v_{0}$ is thus, $v_{0}=\frac{2 \pi r}{t}$ Orbital angular momentum of the Earth $=L_{x}=m v_{0} r$

$$
\begin{aligned}
L & =\frac{2 \pi r^{2} m}{t} \\
& =\frac{2 \pi\left(1.60 \times 10^{11} \mathrm{~m}\right)^{2} \times\left(6.00 \times 10^{34} \mathrm{~kg}\right)}{3.16 \times 10^{7} \mathrm{~s}} \\
L & =2.67 \times 10^{40} \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

The sign is positive because the revolution is counter clockwise.

### 3.6 LAW OF CONSERVATION OF ANGULAR MOMENTUM

The law of conservation of angular momentum states that if no external torque acts on a system, the total angular momentum of the system remains constant.

$$
L_{\text {sita }}=L_{1}+L_{2}+\ldots=\text { constant }
$$

The law of conservation of angular momentum is one of the fundamental principles of Physics. It has been verified from the cosmological to the sub microscopic level. The effect of the law of conservation of angular momentum is readily apparent if a single isolated spinning body alters its moment of inertia.

If a body of moment of inertia $I_{1}$ spinning with angular speed $\omega_{1}$ alters its moment of inertia to $I_{2}$, then its angular speed $\omega_{2}$ also changes so that its angular momentum remains constant.

Hence

$$
I_{1} \omega_{1}=I_{2} \omega_{2}
$$

The angular momentum is a vector quantity with direction along the axis of rotation. Hence, the direction of angular momentum along the axis of rotation also remains fixed. This is illustrated by the fact given below:

The axis of rotation of an object will not change its orientation unless an external torque causes it to do so.

## Do you know?

If you try to sit on a bike at rest, it falls. But if the bike is moving, the angular momentum of the spinning wheel resists any tendency to change and heips to keep the bike upright and stable.
[Image removed]

The ball's speed increases as the string wraps around the finger.

This fact is of great importance for the Earth as it moves around the Sun. No other sizeable torque is experienced by the Earth, because the major force acting on it is the pull of the Sun. The Earth's axle of rotation, therefore, remains fixed in one direction with reference to the universe around us.

# Examples of conservation of angular momentum 

## Aman diving from a diving board

A diver jumping from a springboard has to take a few someraaults in air before touching the water surface, as shown in Fig.3.19. After leaving the springboard, he curls his body by rolling arms and legs in. Due to this, his moment of inertia decreases, and he spins in midair with a large angular velocity. When he is about to touch the water surface, he stretches out his arms and legs. He enters the water at a gentle speed and gets a smooth dive. This is an example of the law of conservation of angular momentum.

## The spinning ice skater

An ice skater as shown in Fig. 3.20 can increase his angular velocity by folding arms and bringing the stretched leg close to the other leg. By doing so, he decreases his moment of inertia. As a result, angular speed increases. When he stretches his hands and a leg outward, the moment of inertia increases and hence angular velocity decreases.

## For your information

It has been noticed that when ice on the polar caps of Earth melts and water flows away in the form of river; the moment of inertia of water and hence that of Earth about its axis of rotation increases due to conservation of angular momentum. Hence, the angular velocity of Earth will decrease, therefore, the duration of day increases slightly.

angular speed at once increases. This is because the moment of inertia decreases on drawing the hands inwards, which increases the angular speed.

# Flywheel 

Flywheel is a mechanical device which consists of a heavy wheel with an axle (Fig. 3.22). It is used to store rotational energy, smooth out output fluctuations and provides stability in a wide range of applications such as bicycles and other vehicles, industrial machinery, gyroscopes, ships and spacecrafts.

## Do you know?

The flywheel called the balance wheel regulates the time keeping mechanism in mechanical clocks and watches by maintaining controlled oscillations rate.

Fig. 3.22: A flywheel
When a fly wheel spins, its angular momentum resists changes to its orientations, maintaining stability. This is useful in systems that need precise control over their orientation without external interference.

## The Gyroscope

Agyroscope is a device which is used to maintain its orientation relative to the Earth's axis or resists changes in its orientation. It consists of a mounted flywheel pivoted in supporting rings as shown in Fig. 3.23. It works on the basis of law of conservation of angular momentum due to its large moment of inertia. When the gyroscope spins at a large angular speed, it gains large angular momentum. It is then difficult to change the orientation of the gyroscope's rotational axis due to its large moment of inertia. A change in orientation requires a change in its angular momentum. To change the direction of a large angular momentum, a corresponding large torque is required. Even if gyroscope is tilted (Fig. 3.24), it still keeps levitated without falling. Hence, it is a reason why a gyroscope can be used to maintain orientation. The

## Work, Energy and Power

## Learning Objectives

After studying this chapter, the students will be able to:

- Derive the formula for kinetic energy [using the equations of motion]
- Derive an expression for absolute potential energy of a body at a certain position in the gravitational field [including escape velocity]
- Deduce the work done from force-displacement graph.
- Differentiate between conservative and non-conservative forces.
- State and use the work - energy theorem in a resistive medium to solve problems.

Work is often thought in terms of physical or mental effort. In Physics, however, the termwork involves two things (i) force, and (ii) displacement. We shall begin with a simple situation in which work is done by a constant force.

### 4.1 WORK DONE BY A CONSTANT FORCE

Let us consider an object which is being pulled by a constant force $F$. The force displaces the object through a displacement $d$ in the direction of force. In such a case, work $W$ is defined as the product of the magnitude of the force $F$ and magnitude of the displacement d. This can be written as:

$$
W=F d
$$

Equation (4.1) shows that if the displacement is zero, no work is done even if a large force is applied. For example, pushing on a wall may tire your muscles, but work done is zero as shown in Fig. 4.1.
The force applied on a body may not always be in the direction of force as shown in Fig. (4.2). If the force $F$ makes an angle 0 with the displacement $d$ (Fig. 4.3), the work done is equal to the product of the component of force along the direction of the displacement and the magnitude of displacement. Then

From the definition of work, we find that:
(i) Work is a scalar quantity.
(ii) If $\theta<90^{\circ}$, work is done and it is said to be positive work.
(iii) If $\theta=90^{\circ}$, no work is done.
(iv) If $\theta>90^{\circ}$, the work done is said to be negative.
(v) Sl unit of work is N m , also known as joule (J).

# 4.2 WORKDONE BYAVARIABLEFORCE 

In many cases, the force does not remain constant during the process of doing work. For example, as a rocket moves away from the Earth, work is done against the force of gravity, which varies as the inverse square of the distance from the Earth's centre. Similarly, the force exerted by a spring increases with the amount of stretch. How can we calculate the work done in such situations?

Figure 4.5 shows the path of a particle in the $x y$ plane as it moves from point $P$ to point $Q$. The path has been divided into $n$ short intervals of displacements $\Delta d_{1}, \Delta d_{2}, \ldots \ldots, \Delta d_{n}$ and $F_{1}, F_{2}, \ldots \ldots, F_{n}$ are the forces acting during these intervals, respectively.

During each small interval, the force is supposed to be approximately constant. So, the work done for the first interval can then be written as
$\Delta W_{1}=\mathbf{F}_{1} \cdot \Delta \mathbf{d}_{1}=F_{1} \cos \theta_{1} \Delta d_{1}$
and in the second interval
$\Delta W_{2}=F_{2} \cdot \Delta d_{2}=F_{2} \cos \theta_{2} \Delta d_{2}$
and so on. The total work done in moving the object can be calculated by adding all these terms.

$$
\begin{aligned}
W_{\text {total }} & =\Delta W_{1}+\Delta W_{2}+\ldots \ldots+\Delta W_{n} \\
& =F_{1} \cos \theta_{1} \Delta d_{1}+F_{2} \cos \theta_{2} \Delta d_{2}+\ldots \ldots+F_{n} \cos \theta_{n} \Delta d_{n} \\
\text { or } \quad W_{\text {total }} & =\sum_{i=1}^{n} F_{i} \cos \theta_{i} \Delta d_{i}
\end{aligned}
$$

We can examine this graphically by plotting $F \cos \theta$ verses $d$ as shown in Fig. 4.6. The displacement $d$ has been sub-divided into the same $n$ equal Intervals. The value of $F \cos \theta$ at the beginning of each interval is indicated in the figure.

A particle acted upon by a variable force, moves along the path shown from point $P$ to point $Q$.

Fig. 4.6

Now the $i^{\text {th }}$ shaded rectangle has an area $F_{i} \cos \theta_{i} \Delta d$ which is the work done during the $i^{\text {th }}$ interval. Thus, the work done given by Eq. 4.4 equals the sum of the areas of all the rectangles. If we sub-divide the distance into a large number of intervals so that each $\Delta d$ becomes very small, the work done given by Eq. 4.4 becomes more accurate. If we let each $\Delta d$ to approach zero, then we obtain an exact result for the work done, such as:

$$
W_{\text {total }}=\underset{\Delta d \rightarrow 0}{\text { Limit }} \sum_{i=1}^{n} F_{i} \cos \theta_{i} \Delta d_{i}
$$

If this limit $\Delta d$ approaches zero, the total area of all the rectangles (Fig. 4.6) approaches the area between the $F \cos \theta$ verses $d$ curve and $x$-axis from P to Q as shown shaded in Fig. 4.7.
Thus, the work done by a variable force in moving a particle between two points is equal to the area under the $F \cos \theta$ verses $d$ curve between the two points $P$ and $Q$ as shown in Fig. 4.7.

Fig. 4.7

Example 4.3 A force $F$ acting on an object varies with distance $d$ as shown in Fig. 4.8. Calculate the work done by the force as the object moves from $d=0$ to $d=6 \mathrm{~m}$.
Solution The work done by the force is equal to the total area under the curve from $d=0$ to $d=6 \mathrm{~m}$. This area is equal to the area of the rectangular section from $d=0$ to

$d=4 \mathrm{~m}$, plus the area of triangular section from $d=4 \mathrm{~m}$ to $d=6 \mathrm{~m}$.

Hence
Work done represented by the area of rectangle $=4 \mathrm{~m} \times 5 \mathrm{~N}$
$=20 \mathrm{Nm}=20 \mathrm{~J}$
Work done represented by the area of triangle $=\frac{1}{2} \times 2 \mathrm{~m} \times 5 \mathrm{~N}$
$=5 \mathrm{Nm}=5 \mathrm{~J}$
Therefore, the total work done
$=20 \mathrm{~J}+5 \mathrm{~J}=25 \mathrm{~J}$

# 4.3 CONSERVATIVE AND NON-CONSERVATIVE FORCES 

## Conservative Forces

The space around the Earth In which its gravitational force acts on a body is called the gravitational field. When an object is moved in the gravitational field, the work is done by the gravitational force. If displacement is in the direction of gravitational force, the work is positive. If the displacement is against the gravitational force, the work is said to be negative.
There is an interesting property of the gravitational force that when an object is moved from one place to another, the work done by the gravitational force does not depend on the choice of the path. Let us explore it. Consider an object of mass $m$ being displaced with constant speed from point $A$ to $B$ along various paths in the presence of a gravitational force (Fig. 4.9). In this case, the gravitational force is equal to the weight
[Image removed]

Fig. 4.9
$m g$ of the object.
The work done by the gravitational force along the path 1 (ADB) can be split into two parts (path AD and path DB). The work done along AD is zero, because the weight mg is perpendicular to this path, whereas the work done along DB is ( $-m g h$ ) because the direction of $m g$ is opposite to that of the displacement i.e., $\theta=180^{\circ}$. Hence, the work done in displacing a body from $A$ to $B$ through path 1 is:

$$
W_{\text {ace }}=0+(-m g h)=-m g h
$$

If we consider the path 2 (ACB), the work done along AC is also (-mgh). Since the work done along CB is zero, therefore,

$$
W_{\text {ace }}=-m g h+0=-m g h
$$

Now consider path 3, i.e., a curved one. Imagine the curved path to be broken down into a

series of horizontal and vertical steps as shown in Fig. 4.10. There is no work done along the horizontal steps, because $m g$ is perpendicular to the displacement for these steps. Work is done by the force of gravity only along the vertical displacements. During the segment CD, $m g$ is not negative; it is positive. But here all $\Delta y$ elements are negative, so the products of $m g$ and $\Delta y$ for all the elements will again be negative. Therefore, we can write:

$$
W_{A B}=-m g\left(\Delta y_{1}+\Delta y_{2}+\Delta y_{3}+\ldots \ldots+\Delta y_{n}\right)
$$

As

$$
\Delta y_{1}+\Delta y_{2}+\Delta y_{3}+\ldots \ldots+\Delta y_{n}=h
$$

Hence

$$
W_{A B}=-m g h
$$

[Image removed]

Fig. 4.10
A smooth path may be replaced by a series of infinitesimal $x$ and $y$ displacements. Work is done only during the $y$ displecements.

The net amount of work done along the curved path $A B$ is still (-mgh). We conclude from the above discussion that:

# Work done by gravitational force is independent of the path followed. 

Can you prove that the work done, along a closed path, such as ACBA or ADBA (Fig. 4.9), by the gravitational force is zero?

If the work done by a force in moving an object between two points is independent of the path followed or the work done in a closed path be zero, the force is called a conservative force.
As shown above, the gravitational force is a conservative force, other examples of conservative force are electrostatic force and elastic spring force.

## Non-Conservative Forces

All types of forces are not conservative forces.
A force is non-conservative if the work done by it in moving an object between two points or in a closed path depends on the path of motion.
The kinetic frictional force is a non-conservative force. When an object slides over a surface, the kinetic frictional force always acts opposite to the motion and does negative work equal in magnitude to the frictional force multiplied by the length of the path. Thus, greater amount of work is done over a longer path between any two points. Hence, the work depends on the choice of path. Moreover, the total work done by a nonconservative force in a closed path is notzero.
Other examples of non-conservative force are air resistance, tension in a string, normal force and propulsion force of a rocket.

### 4.4 POWER

In the definition of work, it is not clear, whether the same amount of work is done in one second or in one hour. The rate, at which work is done, is often of interest in practical applications.

# Piyalue 

Power is the measure of the rate at which work is being done.
If work $\Delta W$ is done in a time interval $\Delta t$, then the average power $P_{w}$ during the interval $\Delta t$ is defined as:

$$
P_{w}=\frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t}
$$

If work is expressed as a function of time, the instantaneous power $P$ at any instant is defined as:

$$
P=\operatorname{Limit}_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t}
$$

where $\Delta W$ is the work done in short interval of time $\Delta t$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Since } \\
& \Delta W=F \cdot \Delta d \\
& \text { Hence } \\
& P=\frac{F \cdot \Delta d}{\Delta t}=F \cdot \frac{\Delta d}{\Delta t} \\
& \text { Since } \\
& \frac{\Delta d}{\Delta t}=v \\
& \text { Hence } \\
& P=F \cdot v
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, power may also be defined as the scaler product of $F$ and $V$.
The SI unit of power is watt, defined as one joule of work done in one second.
Sometimes, for example, in the electrical measurements, the unit of work is expressed as watt second. However, a commercial unit of electrical energy is kilowatt-hour.
One kilowatt- hour is the work done in one hour by an agency whose power is one kilowatt.
Therefore

$$
1 \mathrm{kWh}=1000 \mathrm{~W} \times 3600 \mathrm{~s}
$$

or

$$
1 \mathrm{kWh}=3.6 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~J}=3.6 \mathrm{MJ}
$$

## Do you know?

It takes about $9 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~J}$ of energy to make a car and the car then uses about $1 \times 10^{17} \mathrm{~J}$ of energy from petrol in its life time.

### 4.5 ENERGY

Energy of a body is its capacity to do work. There are two basic forms of energy:

# Physics II 

(i) Kinetic energy
(ii) Potential energy

Kinetic energy is the energy possessed by a body due to its motion and potential energy is the energy possessed by a body due to its changed position.
The kinetic energy and the potential energy both are the kinds of mechanical energy.

## Kinetic Energy

Let us derive a formula for the kinetic energy of a moving body. Consider a car running with a constant speed on a road. If its engine is switched OFF, it will still cover some distance before stopping. As long as it is moving, it is doing work against the force of friction of the road. In other words, during this interval, it will exert a force equal in magnitude to the force of friction $f$. Let the distance travelled before coming to rest be $d$, then the work done by the car would be $f d$. This work is done by the car due to its motion. The ability of a body to do work due to its motion is its kinetic energy. Therefore, kinetic energy of the car is equal to $f d$. The acceleration can be found by using Newton's second law of motion, i.e.,

$$
F=m a
$$

As the car slows down and finally stops, its acceleration a is negative because it is produced by force of friction $f$ acting apposite to the direction of motion. Thus,

$$
f=-m a
$$

or

$$
a=-\frac{f}{m}
$$

We can now determine the value of $(f d)$ by using the third equation of motion, i.e;

$$
2 a S=v^{2}-v^{2}
$$

Here, Initial velocity $\quad v_{i}=v$
Final velocity $\quad v_{f}=0$
Distance $\quad S=d$
Acceleration $\quad a=-\frac{f}{m}$
Putting values in the above equation of motion, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
2 \times\left(\frac{-f}{m}\right) d & =0-v^{2} \\
f d & =\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

As $f d$ is equal to the kinetic energy of body, therefore,

$$
\text { Kinetic energy }=\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}
$$

Since, kinetic energy is equal to work which the body is capable of doing, so the unit of kinetic energy must be that of work, i.e. joule (J).
Example 4.3 A car weighing 18620 N is running with a speed of $16 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. Brakes are applied and it is brought to rest in a distance of 60 m . Determine the average force of

friction acting on it.

# Solation 

Given that $\quad v=16 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}, d=80 \mathrm{~m}, w=18620 \mathrm{~N}$ and $f=$ ?
The kinetic energy of the car is equal to the work done by it before stopping, i.e.,

$$
\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}=f d
$$

Here

$$
m=\frac{w}{g}=\frac{18620 \mathrm{~N}}{9.8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}=1900 \mathrm{~kg}
$$

Putting the value in the above equation, we have

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 1900 \mathrm{~kg} \times\left(16 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\right)^{2}=f \times 80
$$

or

$$
f=3040 \mathrm{~N}
$$

## Potential Energy

The potential energy is possessed by a body because of its position in a force field, e.g. gravitational field or because of its constrained state.
The energy stored in a compressed spring is the potential energy possessed by the spring due to its compressed or stretched state. This form of energy is called the elastic potential energy.

## Absolute Potential Energy

The absolute gravitational potential energy of an object at a certain position is the work done by the gravitational force in displacing the object from that position to infinity where the force of gravity becomes zero.
The relation for the calculation of the work done by the gravitational force or potential energy is $m g h$, which is true only near the surface of the Earth where the gravitational force is nearly constant. But if the body is displaced through a large distance in space, let it be from point 1 to N (Fig. 4.11) in the gravitational field, then the gravitational force will not remain constant, since it varies inversely to the square of the distance.
In order to overcome this difficulty, we divide the distance between points 1 and N into small steps each of length $\Delta r$ so that the value of the force remains constant for each small step. Hence, the total work done can be calculated by adding the work done during all these steps. If $r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$ are the
[Image removed]

Fig. 4.11
distances of points 1 and 2 respectively, from the centre $O$ of the Earth (Fig. 4.11.), the

work done during the first step i.e., displacing a body from point 1 to point 2 can be calculated as below. The distance between the centre of this step and centre of the Earth will be:

$$
r=\frac{r_{1}+r_{2}}{2}
$$

As

$$
r_{2}-r_{1}=\Delta r \quad \text { then } \quad r_{2}=r_{1}+\Delta r
$$

Hence

$$
r=\frac{r_{1}+r_{1}+\Delta r}{2}=r_{1}+\frac{\Delta r}{2}
$$

The gravitational force $F$ at the centre of this step is:

$$
F=G \frac{M m}{r^{2}}
$$

where $m=$ mass of an object, $M=$ mass of the Earth and $G=$ Gravitational constant
Squaring Eq. 4.10

$$
\begin{aligned}
& r^{2}=\left(r_{1}+\frac{\Delta r}{2}\right)^{2} \\
& r^{2}=r_{1}^{2}+2 r_{1} \frac{\Delta r}{2}+\left(\frac{\Delta r}{2}\right)^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

[Image removed]

There is more energy reaching Earth in 10 days of sunlight than in all the fossil fuels on the Earth.

As $(\Delta r)^{2} \ll r_{1}{ }^{2}$, so $(\Delta r)^{2}$ can be neglected as compared to $r_{1}{ }^{2}$.
Hence

$$
r^{2}=r_{1}^{2}+r_{1} \Delta r
$$

Putting the value of $\Delta r=r_{2}-r_{1}$

$$
r^{2}=r_{1}^{2}+r_{1}\left(r_{1}-r_{1}\right)=r_{1} r_{2}
$$

Hence, Eq. 4.11 becomes

$$
F=G \frac{M m}{r_{1} r_{2}}
$$

As this force is assumed to be constant during the interval $\Delta r$, so the work done is:

$$
W_{1} \rightarrow_{2}=F \Delta r=F \Delta r \cos 180^{\circ}=-G M m \frac{\Delta r}{r_{1} r_{2}}
$$

The negative sign indicates that the work has to be done on the body from point 1 to 2 because displacement is opposite to gravitational force. Putting the value of $\Delta r$, we have

$$
W_{1}>_{2}=-G M m \frac{r_{2}-r_{1}}{r_{1} r_{2}}
$$

or

$$
W_{1} \rightarrow_{2}=-G M m\left(\frac{1}{r_{1}}-\frac{1}{r_{2}}\right)
$$

Similarly, the work done during the second step in which the body is displaced from point 2 to 3 is:

$$
W_{2} \rightarrow_{3}=-G M m\left(\frac{1}{r_{2}}-\frac{1}{r_{2}}\right)
$$

and the work done in the last step is:

$$
W_{N-1} \rightarrow_{N}=-G M m \frac{1}{\left(N-1-\frac{1}{r_{N}}\right)}
$$

More coal has been used since 1945 than was used in the whole of history before that.

Hence, the total work done in displacing a body from point 1 to N is calculated by adding up the work done during all these steps.

$$
\begin{aligned}
W_{\text {tubt }} & =W_{1} \rightarrow_{2}+W_{2} \rightarrow_{3}+\ldots \ldots . .+W_{N-1} \rightarrow_{N} \\
& =-G M m\left[\left(\frac{1}{r_{1}}-\frac{1}{r_{2}}\right)+\left(\frac{1}{r_{2}}-\frac{1}{r_{3}}\right)+\ldots \ldots+\left(\frac{1}{r_{N-1}} \frac{1}{r_{N}}\right)\right]
\end{aligned}
$$

On simplification, we have

$$
W_{\text {totel }}=-G M m\left(\frac{1}{r_{1}}-\frac{1}{r_{N}}\right)
$$

If the point N is situated at an infinite distance from the Earth, then

Hence

$$
r_{N}=\infty \quad ; \quad \text { so } \quad \frac{1}{r_{N}}=\frac{1}{\infty}=0
$$

This total work by definition is the absolute potential energy (P.E) as stated earlier represented by $U$.

$$
U=-\frac{G M m}{r}
$$

This is also known as the absolute value of gravitational potential energy of a body at a distance $r$ from the centre of the Earth.
Note that when $r$ increases, $U$ becomes less negative i.e., $U$ increases. It means when we raise a body above the surface of the Earth, its P.E. increases. Therefore, if we want to raise the body up to infinite distance, we will have to do work on it equal to $\frac{G M m}{R}$, so thatits P.E. becomes zero.
Now the absolute potential energy on the surface of the Earth is found by putting $r=R$ (Radius of the Earth), so

$$
\text { Absolute potential energy }=U_{0}=-\frac{G M m}{R}
$$

The negative sign shows that the Earth's gravitational field for mass $m$ is attractive. The above expression gives the work or the energy required to take the body out of the

Earth's gravitational field, where its potential energy with respect to Earth is zero.

# 4.6 ESCAPE VELOCITY 

It is our daily life experience that an object projected upward comes back to the ground after rising to a certain height. This is due to the force of gravity acting downward. With increased initial velocity, the object rises to the greater height before coming back. If we go on increasing the initial velocity of the object, a stage comes when it will not return to the ground. It will escape from the influence of gravity.

The initial velocity of an object with which it goes out of the Earth's gravitational field, is known as escape velocity.

## For your information

Some Escape speeds (km s)

Heavenly body Escape speed
Moon 2.4
Mercury 4.3
Mars 5.0
Venus 10.4
Earth 11.2
Uranus 22.4
Neptune 25.4
Saturn 37.0
Jupiter 61

The escape velocity corresponds to the initial kinetic energy gained by the body, which carries it to an infinite distance from the surface of the Earth.

$$
\text { Initial } K . E .=\frac{1}{2} m v_{\mathrm{ssc}}^{2}
$$

We know that the work done in lifting a body from Earth's surface to an infinite distance is equal to the increase in potential energy.

$$
\text { Incerase in } P . E .=0-\left(-G \frac{M m}{R}\right)=G \frac{M m}{R}
$$

where $M$ and $R$ are the mass and radius of the Earth respectively. The body will escape out of the gravitational field if the initial $K . E$. of the body is equal to increase in $P . E$. Then

$$
\frac{1}{2} m v_{\mathrm{ssc}}^{2}=G \frac{M m}{R}
$$

or

$$
v_{\mathrm{ssc}}=\sqrt{\frac{2 G M}{R}}
$$

As

$$
g=\frac{G M}{R^{2}} \quad \text { or } \quad g R=\frac{G M}{R}
$$

Hence

$$
v_{\mathrm{ssc}}=\sqrt{2 g R}
$$

The value of $v_{\text {sis }}$ comes out to be approximately $11 \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$.

### 4.7 WORK-ENERGY THEOREM

Whenever work is done on a body, it increases its energy. For example, if a force $F$ acts on a body of mass $m$, initially moving with velocity $v_{r}$, through a distance $d$ and increases its velocity to $v_{r}$, then the acceleration produced will be:

$$
2 a d=v_{r}^{2}-v_{r}^{2}
$$

# Physics II 

or

$$
a=\frac{1}{2 d}\left(v_{f}^{2}-v_{f}^{2}\right)
$$

From the second law of motion:

$$
F=m a
$$

or

$$
a=\frac{F}{m}
$$

Comparing Eqs. 4.16 and 4.17, we have

$$
\frac{F}{m}=\frac{1}{2 d}\left(v_{f}^{2}-v_{f}^{2}\right)
$$

or

$$
F d=\frac{1}{2} m v_{f}^{2}-\frac{1}{2} m v_{f}^{2}
$$

## 1444

## 1444

All the food you eat in one day has about the same energy as $1 / 3$ litre of petrol
or

$$
F d=\frac{1}{2} m v_{f}^{2}-\frac{1}{2} m v_{f}^{2}
$$

This expression is the work-energy theorem. It states that:
The change in kinetic energy of an object is equal to the work done on it by a net force.
$W=$ Change in kinetic energy $=(K . E)_{t}-(K . E)_{t}=\frac{1}{2} m v_{f}^{2}-\frac{1}{2} m v_{f}^{2}$
This is also known as work-energy principle.
The work-energy theorem is applicable for any direction of the force relative to the displacement. For instance, an object with kinetic energy can perform work if it is allowed to push or pull on another object. In this case, the work will be taken as negative and the kinetic energy of the object will decrease. The theorem remains valid even if the force may vary from point to point.

Example 4.4 A motorcycle rider weighing 80 kg is coasting down a $24^{\circ}$ slope. The weight of motorcycle is 30 kg . At the top of the slope, the speed of motorcycle is $3.2 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. If the kinetic frictional force is 100 N , what will be the speed of the motorcycle 72 m downhill?
Solution The normal force $F_{n}$ is balanced by the component of weight (mgcos $24^{\circ}$ ) perpendicular to the slope, Let the kinetic frictional force is $f$, then the net force Fis:
or

$$
\begin{aligned}
& F=m g \sin 24^{\circ}-f \quad \text { where } m=\text { total mass }=60 \mathrm{~kg}+30 \mathrm{~kg}=90 \mathrm{~kg} \\
& F=\left(90 \mathrm{~kg} \times 9.8 \mathrm{~ms}^{-2} \times 0.4\right)-100 \mathrm{~N} \\
& F=252.8 \mathrm{~N}
\end{aligned}
$$

Wok done $W=F d=252.8 \mathrm{~N} \times 72 \mathrm{~m}=18201.8 \mathrm{~J}$
As work is positive, so applying work-energy theorem,

$$
W=(K . E)_{t}-(K . E)_{t}
$$

Form here,

$$
(K . E)_{t}=W+(K . E)_{t}
$$

[Image removed]

Putting the values, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{2} m v_{i}^{2} & =W+\frac{1}{2} m v_{i}^{2} \\
\frac{1}{2} \times 90 \mathrm{~kg} \times v_{i}^{2} & =18201 \mathrm{~J}+\frac{1}{2} \times 90 \mathrm{~kg} \times\left(3.2 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\right)^{2} \\
\text { This gives, } \quad v_{i}^{2} & =414.7 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2} \\
\text { or } \quad v_{i} & =\sqrt{414.7 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2}}=20.4 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

# 4.8 INTERCONVERSION OF POTENTIAL ENERGY AND KINETIC ENERGY 

Consider a body of mass $m$ at rest, at a height $h$ above the surface of the Earth as shown in Fig. 4.12. At position A, the body has $P . E .=m g h$ and $K . E .=0$. We release the body and as it falls, we can examine how kinetic and potential energies associated with it interchange.
Let us calculate P.E. and K.E. at the position B when the body has fallen a distance $x$, ignoring air friction.
Now, height from the ground is $(h-x)$, so that

$$
\begin{aligned}
& P . E .=m g(h-x) \\
& K . E .=\frac{1}{2} m v_{B}^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

and

$$
\text { P.E }=m g h
$$

[Image removed]

Fig. 4.12

Velocity $v_{B}$, at position $B$, can be calculated from the relation,

$$
\begin{aligned}
v_{i}^{2} & =v_{i}^{2}+2 g S \\
v_{i} & =0 \\
v_{B}^{2} & =0+2 g x \\
v_{B}^{2} & =2 g x
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore

$$
\begin{aligned}
K . E . & =\frac{1}{2} m(2 g x) \\
& =m g x
\end{aligned}
$$

Total energy at position $B=P . E .+K . E$.

$$
\text { Total energy } \quad=m g(h-x)+m g x=m g h
$$

At position C, just before the body strikes the Earth, P.E. $=0$ and $K . E .=\frac{1}{2} m v_{c}^{2}$, where $v_{c}$ can be found out by the following expression.

i.e.,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& v_{c}^{2}=v_{i}^{2}+2 g h=2 g h \text { as } v_{i}=0 \\
& K . E=\frac{1}{2} m v_{c}^{2}=\frac{1}{2} m \times 2 g h=m g h
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, at point $C$, kinetic energy is equal to the original value of the potential energy of the body. Actually, when a body falls, its velocity increases i.e., the body is being accelerated under the action of gravity. The increase in velocity results in the increase in its kinetic energy. On the other hand, as the body falls, its height decreases and hence, its potential energy also decreases. Thus, we see (Fig. 4.13) that:

$$
\begin{gathered}
\text { Loss in P.E. = Gain in K.E } \\
m g\left(h_{1}-h_{2}\right)=\frac{1}{2} m\left(v_{2}^{2}-v_{1}^{2}\right)
\end{gathered}
$$

where $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ are he velocities of the body at the heights $h_{1}$ and $h_{2}$ respectively. This result is true only when frictional force is not considered.
If we assume that a frictional force $f$ is present during the downward motion, then a part of P.E. is used in doing work against friction equal to $f h$. The remaining $P . E .=m g h-f h$ is converted into K.E.

Hence

$$
m g h-f h=\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}
$$

or

$$
m g h=\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}+f h
$$

Thus
Loss in P.E. = Gain in K.E. + Work done against friction
Conversely,
Loss of K.E. = Gain in P.E. + Work done against friction

# Example 4.5 

A car weighing 1100 kg is moving with a velocity of $12 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. When it is at point $P$, its engine stops. If the frictional force is 120 N , what will be its velocity at point $Q$ ? How far beyond $Q$ will it go before coming to rest?

## Solution

The kinetic energy possessed by the car at point $P$ will partly be converted into P.E. and partly used up in doing work against friction as it reaches point $Q$. Therefore,
Loss of K.E. = Gain in P.E. + Work against friction

\end{aligned}
$$

Velocity at point $Q, \quad v_{i}=\sqrt{109.4 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2}}=10.5 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$

$$
\begin{gathered}
\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}-f S \\
\frac{1}{2} \times 1100 \mathrm{~kg} \times 109.4 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2}=120 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{2} \times S \\
S=501 \mathrm{~m} \text {. approximately }

- Explain why real fluids are viscous fluids.
- Describe how viscous forces in a fluid cause a retarding force on an object moving through it.
- Describe super fluidity [As the state in which a liquid will experience zero viscosity. Students should know the implications of this state e.g. this allows for super fluids to creep over the walls of containers to 'empty' themselves. It also implies that if you stir a superfluid, the vortices will keep spinning indefinitely.]
- Analyze the real-world applications of the Bemoulli effect [For example, atomizers in perfume bottles, the swinging trajectory of a spinning cricket ball and the lift of a spinning golf ball (the Magnus effect), the use of Venture ducts in filter pumps and car engineers to adjust the flow of fluid, etc.]

Materials have specific uses depending upon their characteristics and properties, such as hardness, ductility, malleability, etc. What makes a metal hard and other soft? It depends upon the structure, the particular order and bonding of atoms and molecules in a material. Similarly, the study of fluids in motion is relatively complicated but analysis can be simplified by making a few assumptions. The analysis is further simplified by the use of two important conservation principles, the conservation of mass and conservation of energy. The law of conservation of mass gives us the equation of continuity while the law of conservation of energy is the basis of Bemoulli's equation.

# 5.1 CLASSIFICATION OF SOLIDS 

## Crystalline Solids

In crystalline solids, there is a regular arrangement of atoms and molecules. The neighbours of every molecule are arranged in a regular pattern that is consistent throughout the crystal. There is, thus, an ordered structure in crystalline solids. Most solids, like metals and ceramics have a crystalline structure. This means their atoms, molecules or ions are arranged in a regular pattern. The arrangement of molecules, atoms or ions within all types of crystalline solids can be studied using various techniques such as X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). It should be noted that atoms, molecules or ions in a crystalline solid are not static. For example, each atom in a crystal vibrates about a fixed point with an amplitude that increases with rise in temperature. It is the average atomic positions which are perfectly ordered over large distances.
The cohesive forces between atoms, molecules or ions in crystalline solids maintain the strict long-range order inspite of atomic vibrations. For every crystal, however, there is a temperature at which the vibrations become greater that the structure suddenly breaks up, and the solid melts. The transition from solid (order) to liquid (disorder) is, therefore, abrupt or discontinuous. Every crystalline solid has a definite melting point e.g., Quartz, Calcite, Sugar, Mica, diamond, etc.

## Amorphous or Glassy Solids

[Image removed]

The word amorphous means without form or structure. Thus, in amorphous solids there is no regular arrangement of molecules like that in crystalline solids. We can, therefore, say that amorphous solids are more like liquids with the disordered structure frozen in.
For example, ordinary glass, which is a solid at ordinary temperature, has no regular arrangement of molecules. On heating, it gradually softens into a paste like state before it becomes a very viscous liquid at almost $800^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Thus, amorphous solids are also called glassy solids. This type of solids has no definite melting point e.g., plastic, glass, fused silicon, etc.

## Polymeric Solids

Polymers are solid materials with a structure that is intermediate between order and disorder. They can be classified as partially or poorly crystalline solids.

Polymers form a large group of naturally occurring and synthetic materials. Plastics and synthetic rubbers are termed as polymers because they are formed by polymerization reactions in which relatively simple molecules are chemically combined into massive long chain molecules, or three-dimensional structures. These materials have rather low specific gravity compared with even the lightest of metals, and yet exhibit good strength to weight ratio.
Polymers consist wholly or in part of chemical combinations of carbon with oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen and other metallic or non metallic elements. Polythene, polystyrene and nylon, etc. are examples of polymers. Natural rubber is composed in the pure state entirely of a hydrocarbon with the formula $\left(\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5}\right)_{n}$.

# 5.2 MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS 

## Deformation in Solids

If we hold a soft rubber ball in our hand and then squeeze it, the shape or volume of the ball will change. However, if we stop squeezing the ball, and open our hand, the ball will return to its original spherical shape. This has been illustrated schematically in Fig. 5.1.
Similarly, if we hold two ends of a rubber string in our hands, and move our hands apart to some extent, the length of the
[Image removed]
string will increase under the action of the applied force (a) Originalrubber ball exerted by our hands. Greater the applied force, larger will be (b) Squeezed rubber ball the increase in length. Now on removing the applied force, the (c) Rubber ball after removing string will return to its original length. From these examples, it is concluded that deformation (i.e., change in shape, length or volume) is produced when a body is subjected to some external force.
In crystalline solids, atoms are usually arranged in a certain order. These atoms are held about their equilibrium position, which depends on the strength of the inter-atomic cohesive force between them. Under the influence of external force, distortion occurs in the solid bodies because of the displacement of the atoms from their equilibrium position and the body is said to be in a state of stress. After the removal of external force, the atoms return to their equilibrium position, and the body regains its original shape, provided that external applied force was not too great. The ability of the body to return to its original shape is called elasticity. Figure 6.2. illustrates deformation produced in a unit cell of a crystal subjected to an external applied force.

# 5.3 STRESS, STRAIN AND YOUNG'S MODULUS 

The results of mechanical tests are usually expressed in terms of stress and strain, which are defined in terms of applied force and deformation.

## Stress

It is defined as the force applied per unit area to produce any change in the shape, volume or length of a body. Mathematically, it is expressed as:

$$
\text { Stress }(\sigma)=\frac{\text { Force }(F)}{\text { Area }(A)}
$$

The SI unit of stress ( $\sigma$ ) is newton per square metre ( $\mathrm{N} \mathrm{m}^{2}$ ), which is given the name pascal (Pa). Stress may cause a change in length, volume and shape. When a stress changes length, it is called the tensile stress, when it changes the volume, it is called the volume stress and when it changes the shape, it is called the shear stress.

## Strain

Strain is a measure of the deformation of a solid when stress is applied to it. In the case of deformation in one dimension, strain is defined as the fractional change in length. If $\Delta L$ is the change in length and $L$ is the original length (Fig. 5.3-a), then strain is given by

$$
\text { Strain }(\varepsilon)=\frac{\text { Change in length }(\Delta L)}{\text { Original length }(L)}
$$

Since strain is the ratio of lengths, it is dimensionless and therefore, has no units. If strain $\varepsilon$ is due to tensile stress $\sigma$ it is called tensile strain, and if it is produced as a result of compressive stress $\sigma$, it is termed as compressive strain.
In case when the applied stress changes the volume, the change in volume per unit volume is known as volumetric strain as shown in Fig. 5.3 (b), thus

Volumetric strain $\left(\varepsilon_{v}\right)=\frac{\Delta V}{V_{0}}$
[Image removed]

Fig. 5.3(b): Volumetric strain
[Image removed]

Fig. 5.3(c): Shear strain

Let $y$ be the distance between two opposite faces of a rigid body (Fig. 5.3-c), which are subjected to shear stress one of its face slides through a distance $\Delta x$, then shear strain is produced which is is given by

$$
\text { Shear strain }(\gamma)=\frac{\Delta x}{\gamma}=\tan \theta
$$

However, for small value of angle $\theta$, measured in radian $\tan \theta \cong \theta$, so that

$$
\gamma=0
$$

## Young's Modulus

The stress applied per unit strain is called Young's modulus
i.e. $Y=\frac{\text { Tensile stress }}{\text { Tensile strain }}$

$$
Y=\frac{F / A}{\Delta L / L_{0}}
$$

It has the same unit as that of stress i.e., $\mathrm{N} \mathrm{m}^{2}$. The value of Young's modulus of different material is given in Table 5.1.
There are various methods to determine the Young's modulus of a wire. One of the method is Searle's method.

## Chapter 5. Solids and Fluid Dynamics

Although it is named after the 19th century British Scientist Thames Young, the concept was developed in 1727 by Leonhard Euller.

# 5.4 DETERMINATION OF YOUNG'S MODULUS OF A WIRE 

Experimentally, the magnitude of Young's modulus for a material in the form of wire can be found out mostly with the help of Searle's apparatus as shown in Fig. 5.4.
It consists of two wires, reference wire and test wire of equal lengths of same material having same diameters attached to a rigid support. Both wires are connected to horizontal bars (frames $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$ ) at the other ends. Hang a constant weight to the hook of horizontal bar of reference wire and hanger on test wire so that wire remains stretched and free from kinks.

## Procedure

The following procedure is adopted for finding Young's modulus of a wire experimentally.

1. Measure the initial length $L_{0}$ of the wire using a metre scale.
2. Measure the diameter ' $d$ ' of the wire using a screw guage. The diameter should be messured at several
[Image removed]

different points along the wire and take average.
3. Adjust the spirit level so that it is in horizontal position by turning the micrometer. Record the micrometer reading to use it as the reference reading.
4. Load the test wire with a further weight, the spirit level tilts due to elongation of the test wire.
5. Adjust the micrometer screw to restore the spirit level in the horizontal position. Subtract the first micrometer reading from the second micrometer reading to obtain the extension of the test wire.
6. Calculate stress and strain from the following formula:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Stress } & =\frac{\text { Weight }}{\text { Area of wire }}=\frac{F}{A}=\frac{m g}{\pi r^{2}} \\
\text { Strain } & =\frac{\Delta L}{L_{y}}=\frac{\text { Change in length }}{\text { Original length }}
\end{aligned}
$$

7. Repeat the above steps by increasing load on test wire to obtain more values of stresses and strains.
8. Plot the above values on stress strain graph, it should be straight line. Now determine the value of slope $Y$. The value of slope is equal to Young's modulus of wire.

# 5.5 ELASTIC DEFORMATION, PLASTIC DEFORMATION AND ELASTIC LIMIT 

In a tensile test machine, metal wire is extended at a specified deformation rate, and stresses generated in the wire during deformation are continuously measured by a suitable electronic device fitted in the mechanical testing machine. Force-elongation diagram or stress-strain curve is plotted automatically on X-Y chart recorder. A typical stress-strain curve for a ductile material is shown in Fig. 5.5.
In the initial stage of deformation, stress is increased linearly with the strain till we reach point $A$ on the stress-strain curve. This is called proportional limit $\left(\sigma_{0}\right)$. It is defined as the greatest stress that a material can withstand without losing straight line proportionality between stress and strain. Hooke's law which states that the strain (deformation) is directly proportional to stress (force or load) is obeyed in the region OA. From A to B, stress and strain are not proportional.

## Elastic limit

[Image removed]

Strain
Fig. 5.5: Stress-strain curve of a typical ductile material.

If the load is removed at any point between $O$ and $B$, the curve will be retraced and the material will return to its original state. In the region OB , the material is said to be

elastic. The point $B$ is called the yield point. The value of stress at $B$ is known as elastic limit $\sigma_{e}$.

# Plastic Deformation 

If the stress is increased beyond the yield stress or elastic limit of the material, the specimen becomes permanently changed and does not recover its original shape or dimension after the stress is removed. This kind of behaviour is called plasticity. The region of plasticity is represented by the portion of the curve from $B$ to $C$, the point $C$ in Fig. 5.5 represents the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) $\sigma_{e}$ of the material. The UTS is defined as the maximum stress that a material can withstand, and can be regarded as the nominal strength of the material. Once point $C$ corresponding to UTS is crossed, the material breaks at point D, responding the fracture stress ( $\sigma_{i}$ ).

## Ductile substances

Substances which undergo plastic deformation until they break, are known as ductile substances. For example, Lead, copper and wrought iron are ductile substances.

## Brittle Substances

The substances which break just after the elastic limit is reached, are known as brittle substances. For example, glass and high carbon steel are brittle. Moreover, Beryllium, Bismuth, Chromium are also brittle metals.

Example 5.1 A steel wire 12 mm in diameter is fastened to a log and is then pulled by a tractor. The length of steel wire between the log and the tractor is 11 m . A force of $10,000 \mathrm{~N}$ is required to pull the log. Calculate: (a) the stress and strain in the wire. (b) how much does the wire stretch when the log is pulled? $\left(E=200 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~m}^{2}\right)$

Solution (a) Tensile stress $\sigma=\frac{F}{A}=\frac{10,000 \mathrm{~N}}{3.14\left(6 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m}\right)^{2}}=88.46 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{Nm}^{-2}$
Tensile strain $\varepsilon=\frac{\Delta L}{L_{0}}$; also $E=\frac{\text { Stress }}{\text { Strain }}=\frac{88.46 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{Nm}^{2}}{\text { Strain }}=200 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{Nm}^{2}$

$$
\text { Strain }=\frac{88.46 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{Nm}^{2}}{200 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{Nm}^{2}}=4.4 \times 10^{-4}
$$

(b) Using the relation; Strain $=\frac{\Delta L}{L_{0}}$ or $\Delta L=$ Strain $\times L_{0}=4.4 \times 10^{-4} \times 11 \mathrm{~m}=4.84 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m}$

### 5.6 STRAIN ENERGY IN DEFORMED MATERIALS

When a body is deformed by a force, work is done against elastic restoring force. It is stored in it as its potential energy and is equal to the gain in potential energy of the molecules of a body due to the displacement of these molecules from their mean positions.

## Derivation of Expression for Energy Stored in a Stretched Material

Consider a material in the form of a spring as shown in Fig. 5.6. It is stretched by a

force $F$ through extension $x$. As the extension is directly proportional to the stretching force within the elastic limit, therefore the force increases uniformly from zero to $F$ as shown in Fig. 5.7. Thus, the average force that stretches the spring through $x$ is $1 / 2 F$. Hence work done by the stretching force will be given as:
Work done $=$ Average force $\times$ Distance in the direction of the force

$$
W=\frac{1}{2} F \times x
$$

From Hooke's law

$$
F=k(x)
$$

Therefore,

$$
W=\left(\frac{1}{2} k x\right) \cdot(x)=\frac{1}{2} k x^{2}
$$

or

$$
W=\text { Area of } O P Q
$$

The work done by the stretching force is stored in the spring as its strained energy and is equal to the potential energy stored in its molecules.
Strained energy stored in the body $E=\frac{1}{2} F \cdot x=\frac{1}{2} k x^{2}$
For your intonstion
The amount of work done in stretching a material is equal to the average force applied multiplied by the distance moved.
Therefore, the area under a force-extension graph represents the work done to stretch the material, Work done to stretch the material is also equal to elastic $P E$. stored in the material.

# 5.7 ARCHIMEDES' PRINCIPLE AND FLOATATION 

An air-filled balloon immediately shoots up to the surface when released under the surface of water. The same would happen if a piece of wood is released under water. We might have noticed that a mug filled with water feels light under water but feels heavy as soon as we take it out of water.
More than two thousand years ago, the Greek scientist, Archimedes noticed that there is an upward force which acts on an object which is kept inside a liquid. As a result, an apparent reduction in weight of the object is observed. This upward force acting on the object is called the upthrust of the liquid. Archimedes' principle states that:

When an object is totally or partially immersed in a liquid, an upthrust acts on it equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces.
Consider a solid cylinder of cross-sectional area $A$ and height $h$ immersed in a liquid as shown in Fig. 5.8. Let $h_{1}$ and $h_{2}$ be the depths of the top and bottom faces of the cylinder respectively from the surface of the liquid. Then

$$
h_{2}-h_{1}=h
$$

If $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ are the liquid pressures at depths $h_{1}$ and $h_{2}$ respectively and $\rho$ is its density, then using equation $P=\rho g h$ of liquid pressure at height $h$ :

$$
P_{1}=\rho g h_{1}
$$

and $\quad P_{2}=\rho g h_{2}$
Let the force $F_{1}$ be exerted at the top of cylinder by the liquid due to pressure $P_{2}$ and the force $F_{2}$ be exerted at the bottom of the cylinder by the liquid due to $P_{2}$. Then $F_{1}=P_{1} A=\rho g h_{1} A$
and $\quad F_{2}=P_{2} A=\rho g h_{2} A$
[Image removed]

Fig. 5.8. Upthrust on a body immersed in a liquid is equal to the weight of the liquid displaced.
$F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$ are the forces acting on the opposite faces of the cylinder. Therefore, the net force $F$ will be equal to the difference of these forces. This net force $F$ on the cylinder is called the upthrust of the liquid. Hence

$$
\begin{aligned}
F_{2}-F_{1} & =\rho g h_{1} A-\rho g h_{1} A \\
& =\rho g A\left(h_{2}-h_{1}\right) \ldots \ldots(5.10)
\end{aligned}
$$

or Upthrust of liquid $=\rho g A h$

$$
\text { Upthrust }=\rho g V
$$

Here $A h$ is the volume $V$ of the cylinder and is equal to the volume of the liquid displaced by the cylinder, therefore, $\rho g V$ is the weight of the liquid displaced. This equation shows that an upthrust acts on a body immersed in a liquid and is equal to the weight of liquid displaced, which is Archimede's principle.

Example 5.2 A wooden cube of sides 10 cm each has been dipped completely in water. Calculate the upthurst of water acting on it.

# Solution 

Given

| Length of side | $L=10 \mathrm{~cm}=0.1 \mathrm{~m}$ |
| :-- | :-- |
| Volume | $V=L^{2}=(0.1 \mathrm{~m})^{2}=1 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m}^{3}$ |
| Density of water | $\rho=1000 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}$ |
| Upthrust | $F=$ ? |

Using Archimede's principle
Upthrust of water

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =\rho g V \\
& =1000 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3} \times 9.8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-2} \times 1 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m}^{3}=9.8 \mathrm{~N}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Brain teaser

Why does a ship made of heavy steel float on water, while a small rock sink?

Thus, upthrust of water acting on the wooden cube is 9.8 N .

# Floatation 

An object sinks into a fluid if its weight is greater than the upthrust acting on it. However, an object floats if its weight is equal or less than the upthrust. When an object floats in a fluid, the upthrust acting on it is equal to the weight of the object. In case of floating object, the object may be partially immersed. The upthrust is always equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. This is the principle of floatation. It states that:

A floating object displaces a fluid having weight equal to the weight of the object.
Archimedes' principle is applicable on liquids as well as on gases. We find numerous applications of this principle in our daily life.

## Applications

Following are some important applications of Archimedes' principle.

## 1. Hot-air balloon

The reason why hot-air balloons (Fig. 5.9) rise and float in mid-air is because of the density of the hot-air balloon is less than the surrounding air. When the upthrust of the surrounded air is more, it starts to rise. This is done by varying the quantity of hot air in the balloon.
[Image removed]

Fig. 5.9

## 2. Wooden block floating on water

A wooden block floats on water. It is because the weight of an equal volume of water is greater than the weight of the block. According to the principle of floatation, a body floats if its displaced water is equal to the weight of the body when it is partially or completely immersed in water.

## 3. Ships and boats

Ships and boats are designed on the same principle of floatation. They carry passengers and goods over water. It would sink in water if its total weight becomes greater than the upthrust of water.

## 4. Submarine

A submarine can travel over as well as under water using the same principle of floatation.
It floats over water when the weight of water equal to its volume is greater than its weight. Under this condition, it is similar to a ship and remains partially above water level. It has a system of tanks which can be filled with and emptied from seawater. When these tanks are

Fig.5.10 (b): Submarine

# Physics II 

filled with seawater, the weight of the submarine increases. As soon as its weight becomes greater than the upthrust, it dives into water and remains under water. To come up on the surface, the tanks are made empty from seawater.
Example 5.3 An empty meteorological balloon weighs 80 N . It is filled with 10 cubic metres of hydrogen. How much maximum contents the balloon can lift besides its own weight? The density of hydrogen is $0.09 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}$ and the density of air is $1.3 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}$.

## Solution Given:

Weight of the balloon $w=80 \mathrm{~N}$
Volume of hydrogen $V=10 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$
Density of hydrogen $\rho_{1}=0.09 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{3}$
Density of air $\rho_{2}=1.3 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}$
Weight of hydrogen $w_{1}=$ ?
Weight of the contents $w_{2}=$ ?
Upthrust $F=$ Weight of air displaced
$=\rho_{1} g V$
$=1.3 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3} \times 9.8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-2} \times 10 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$
$=127.4 \mathrm{~N}$
Weight of hydrogen $w_{1}=\rho_{1} \mathrm{Vg}$
$=0.09 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3} \times 10 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \times 9.8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}$
Total weight lifted $=w+w_{2}+w_{0}$
To lift the contents, the total weight of the balloon should not exceed $F$.
Thus

$$
\begin{aligned}
w+w_{1}+w_{2} & =F \\
80 \mathrm{~N}+8.82 \mathrm{~N}+w_{2} & =127.4 \mathrm{~N} \\
w_{0} & =38.58 \mathrm{~N}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the maximum weight of 38.58 N can be lifted by the balloon in addition to its own weight.

Moving fluids have great importance. In order to find the behaviour of the fluid in motion, we consider their flow through the pipes. When a fluid is in motion, its flow can take place in two ways, either streamline or turbulent.

## Streamline or Laminar Flow

The flow is said to be streamline or laminar flow.

If every particle that passes a particular point, moves along exactly the same path, as followed by particles which passed that points earlier.

In a steady flow of a fluid, the motion of the particles is smooth and regular, as shown in Fig. 5.11. The smooth path followed by fluid particles in laminar flow is called a streamline. The streamline may be the straight or curved and tangent to any point gives the direction of flow of a fluid. The different

Fig. 5.11: Streamlines (laminar flow)
streamlines cannot cross each other.
Example: A fluid flowing in a pipe as shown in Fig. 5.12 will have certain velocity $v_{1}$ at $P$, a velocity $v_{2}$ at $Q$ and so on. If the velocity of a particle of the fluid at $P, Q$ and $R$ does not change with the passage of time, then the flow is said to be steady flow or streamline flow.
[Image removed]

Fig. 5.12: The velocities of the particles at different points on streamline.

The line PQR which represents the path followed by the particle is called a streamline. It represents the fixed path followed by orderly processing particles. In streamline flow, all the particles passing through $P$ also pass through $Q$ and $R$. It means that two streamlines cannot cross each other.

# Turbulent Flow 

The irregular or unsteady flow of the fluid is called turbulent flow.
[Image removed]

Fig. 5.13: Turbulent flow

Above a certain velocity of the fluid flow, the motion of the fluid becomes unsteady and irregular. Under this condition, the velocity of the fluid changes abruptly as shown in the Fig. 5.13. In this case, the exact path of the particles cannot be considered.
If two streamlines cross each other, then the particles will go in one or in the other directions and flow will not be a steady flow. Such a flow is a turbulent flow. When the flow is unsteady or turbulent, there are eddies and whirlpools in the motion and the paths of the particles are continuously changing.

## Ideal Fluid

The behaviour of the fluid which satisfies the following conditions is called Ideal fluid:

1. The fluid is non-viscous i.e., there is no frictional force between adjacent layers of the fluid.
[Image removed]

Formula One racing cars have a streamlined design.
[Image removed]

Dolphins have streamlined bodies to assist their movement in water.

2. The fluid is incompressible i.e., its density is constant.
3. The fluid motion is steady.

# Rate of Flow 

The rate of flow of a fluid through a pipe is the volume of the fluid passing through any section of pipe per unit time.

## Formula For Rate of Flow

Consider a fluid flowing through a pipe of area of cross-section $A$ as shown in Fig. 5.14. Let the velocity of the fluid be $v$ and it flows through the pipe for time $t$, then the distance covered by the fluid in time is:

$$
t=v t
$$

[Image removed]

Fig. 5.14: Rate of flow of a liquid
where $t$ is the length of the pipe through which the fluid passes in time $t$. Volume of the fluid passing through the pipe in time $t$, is:

$$
A \times t=A v t
$$

Thus The rate of flow of the liquid $=\frac{\text { Volume }}{\text { Time }}$

$$
=\frac{A v t}{t}=A v
$$

$$
\text { Rate of flow }=A v
$$

In SI units, it is measured in cubic metre per second ( $\mathrm{m}^{3} \mathrm{~s}^{1}$ ). Sometimes, it is also measured in litres per second ( $\mathrm{L} \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ ).

## Steady Flow

If the overall flow pattern does not change with time, the flow is called steady flow.
In steady flow, every particle of the fluid follows the same flow line as its previous particle.

### 5.9 EQUATION OF CONTINUITY

## Statement

The product of cross-sectional area of the pipe and the fluid speed (i.e., $A v$ ) at any point along the pipe is a constant. This constant is equal to the volume flow per second of the fluid or simply the flow rate.

Thus

$$
A v=\text { Constant }=\frac{\text { Volume }}{\text { Time }}
$$

Consider a fluid flowing through a pipe of non-uniform size.
[Image removed]

Fig. 5.15: Steady flow of a fluid

The particles in the fluid move along the same lines in a steady state flow as shown in Fig 5.15.
If we consider the flow for a short interval of time $\Delta t$, the fluid at the lower end of the tube covers a distance $\Delta x$, with a velocity $v_{1}$, then distance covered by the fluid is:

$$
\Delta x_{1}=v_{1} \Delta t
$$

Let $A_{1}$ be the area of cross-section of the lower end, then volume of the fluid that flows into the tube at $A_{1}$ is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& V=A_{1} \Delta x_{1} \\
& \text { or } \quad V=A_{1} v_{1} \Delta t
\end{aligned}
$$

## Scientific Fact

Euler obtained the continuity equation for a incompressible fluid with a large number of terms in 1752. Later, it was translated by C. Truesdell from Englisin in 1954.

If $\rho_{1}$ is the density of the fluid, then the mass of the fluid contained in the shaded region (through $A_{1}$ ) is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Delta m_{1}=\text { Volume } \times \text { Density } \\
& \text { or } \quad \Delta m_{1}=A_{1} v_{1} \Delta t \times \rho_{1}
\end{aligned}
$$

Similarly, the mass of the fluid that moves with velocity $v_{2}$ through the upper end of the pipe having cross-sectional area $A_{2}$ in the same time $\Delta t$ is given by

$$
\Delta m_{2}=A_{2} v_{2} \Delta t \times \rho_{2}
$$

where $\rho_{2}$ is the density of the fluid flowing out through $A_{2}$ and $\Delta m_{2}$ indicates small mass. If the fluid is incompressible and the flow is steady, the mass of the fluid is conserved. That is the mass flowing into the bottom of the pipe through $A_{1}$ in a time $\Delta t$ must be equal to the fluid flowing out though $A_{2}$ in the same time. Therefore,

$$
\Delta m_{1}=\Delta m_{2}
$$

So

$$
A_{1} v_{1} \Delta t \times \rho_{1}=A_{2} v_{2} \Delta t \times \rho_{2}
$$

or

$$
A_{1} v_{2} \rho_{1}=A_{2} v_{2} \rho_{2}
$$

Equation (5.15) is called the equation of continuity. Since density is constant for the steady flow of incompressible fluid, therefore, the equation of continuity becomes:

$$
A_{1} v_{1}=A_{2} v_{2}
$$

Equation (5.16) states that in steady flow, the rate of flow of the fluid inward is equal to the rate of flow of the fluid outward.
This equation justifies the conservation of mass of the fluid which is flowing through a pipe.

A water hose with an internal diameter of 20 mm at the outlet discharge 30 kg of water in 60 s . Calculate the water speed at the outlet. Assume the density of water is $1000 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}$ and its flow is steady.

Internal diameter of water hose $D=20 \mathrm{~mm}=0.02 \mathrm{~m}$
Solution Radius

From equation of continuity, the mass of water discharging per second through area $A$ is:

[Image removed]

As the water falls, its speed increases and so, is cross sectional area decreases as mandated by the continuity equation.

## For your information

The equation of continuity is applied to:
(i) blood flow in arteries and veins
(ii) water flow in rivers and pipes
(iii) air flow in duct and ventilation systems.

# 5.10 INCREASEIN FLOWVELOCITY 

We can increase the flow velocity of water in a rubber pipe by squeezing it. When we squeeze the rubber pipe, we decrease the cross-sectional area through which the water flows. According to the equation of continuity,

$$
A_{1} v_{1}=A_{2} v_{2}
$$

where $A$ is the cross-sectional area and $v$ is the flow velocity. By decreasing the crosssectional area $\left(A_{2}<A_{1}\right)$, the velocity of the water $\left(v_{2}\right)$ must increase to maintain the same flow rate. Therefore, squeezing the rubber pipe increases the flow velocity of fluid.

### 5.11 BERNOULLI'S EQUATION

The sum of pressure, $K . E$. per unit volume and P.E. per unit volume of an ideal fluid throughoutits steady flowremains constant.

As the fluid moves through a pipe of varying crosssection and height, the pressure will change along the pipe. Bernoulli's equation is the fundamental equation in fluid dynamics that relates pressure to fluid speed and height.
[Image removed]

Fig. 5.16: The speed of water spraying from the end of a garden hose increases as the hose is squeezed with the thumb.

In deriving Bernoulli's equation, we assume that the fluid is incompressible, non-viscous and flows in a steady state manner. Let us consider the flow of the fluid through the pipe in time $t$, as shown in Fig. 5.17.
The force on the upper end of the fluid is $P_{1} A_{1}$ where $P_{1}$ is the pressure and $A_{1}$ is the area of cross-section at the upper end. The work done on the fluid, by the fluid behind it, in moving it through a distance $\Delta x_{1}$, will be:

$$
W_{1}=F_{1} \Delta x_{1}=P_{1} A_{1} \Delta x_{1}
$$

Similarly, the work done on the fluid at the lower end is:

$$
W_{2}=-F_{2} \Delta x_{2}=-P_{2} A_{2} \Delta x_{2}
$$

[Image removed]

Fig. 5.17: An ideal flow of fluid through a non-uniform cross-section pip at different heights.
where $P_{2}$ is the pressure, $A_{2}$ is the area of cross-section of lower end and $\Delta x_{2}$ is the distance moved by the fluid in same time interval $t$. The work $W_{2}$ is taken to be -ve as this work is done against the fluid force. The net work done will be:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& W=W_{1}+W_{2} \\
& W=P_{1} A_{1} \Delta x_{1}-P_{2} A_{2} \Delta x_{2} \\
& \text { or } \\
& W_{1} A_{1} v_{1} t-P_{2} A_{2} v_{1} t
\end{aligned}
$$

From equation of continuity;

Hence

$$
A_{1} v_{1}=A_{1} v_{2}
$$

$$
A_{1} v_{1} t=A_{2} v_{2} t=V \text { (volume) }
$$

So

$$
W=\left(P_{1}-P_{2}\right) V
$$

If $m$ is the mass and $p$ is the density, then $V=\frac{m}{p}$. So, Eq. (5.18) becomes:

$$
W=\left(P_{1}-P_{2}\right) \frac{m}{p}
$$

A part of this work is utilized by the fluid in changing its $K . E$. and a part is used in changing its gravitational P.E.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Change in } K . E .=\Delta K . E .=\frac{1}{2} m v_{2}^{2}-\frac{1}{2} m v_{1}^{2} \\
& \text { Change in } P . E .=\Delta P . E=m g h_{2}-m g h_{1}
\end{aligned}
$$

where $h_{1}$ and $h_{2}$ are the heights of the upper and lower ends respectively.
Applying the law of conservation of energy to this volume of the fluid, we have

$$
\left(P_{1}-P_{2}\right) \frac{m}{\rho}=\frac{1}{2} m v_{2}^{2}-\frac{1}{2} m v_{1}^{2}+m g h_{2}-m g h_{1} \ldots \ldots(5.22)
$$

Rearranging Eq. (5.22), we have

$$
P_{1}+\frac{1}{2} \rho v_{1}^{2}+\rho g h_{1}=P_{2}+\frac{1}{2} \rho v_{2}^{2}+\rho g h_{2}
$$

This is Bernoulli's equation and is often expressed as:

$$
P+\frac{1}{2} \rho v^{2}+\rho g h=\text { constant }
$$

# 5.12 USES OF BERNOULLI'S EQUATION 

A number of devices operate by means of pressure difference that results from changes in the speed of the fluid.

## 1. Aeroplane Wings

Uplifting of an aeroplane is due to the designing of Its wings, which deflect the air so that streamlines are closer together above the wing than below it as illustrated in Fig.5.18. We have seen that where the streamlines are forced closer together, the speed is faster. Thus, air is travelling faster on the upper side of the wing than
[Image removed]

Fig. 5.18: Lift of an acroplano
on the lower. The pressure will be lower at the top of the wing, and the wing will be forced upward and the lift of an aeroplane is due to this effect.

## 2. Swing of a Ball

When a ball is thrown or kicked with spin or the ball is made smoother on one side by the bowler and remains rough on the other side, the air moves faster over rough side and slows over the smoother (Fig. 5.19). According to Bernoulli's equation, the faster moving air creates lower pressure, while the slower moving air creates higher pressure, this pressure difference generates a sideways force, known as Magnus effect which causes the ball to curves in the air.

## 3. Filter Pump

[Image removed]

Fig. 5.19: Turbulent flow

A filter pump has a constriction in the centre, so that a jet of water from the tap flows faster here. This causes a drop in pressure near it and air, therefore, flows in from the side tube. The air and water together are expelled through the lower part of the pump (Fig. 5.20).

[Image removed]

# 4. Carburetor 

The carburetor of a car engine uses a Venturi duct to feed the correct mixture of air and petrol to the cylinders. Air is drawn through the duct and along a pipe to the cylinders (Fig. 5.21). Atiny inlet at the side of duct is fed with petrol.
The air through the duct moves very fast, creating low pressure in the duct, which draws petrol vapours into the air stream.

## 5. Paint Sprayer

A stream of air passing over a tube dipped in a liquid will cause the liquid to rise in the tube as shown in Fig. 5.22. This effect is used in perfume bottles and paint sprayers. Actually when the rubber ball of atomizer is squeezed, the air is blown through tube and it rushes out through the narrow aperture with high speed and it causes fall of pressure. So, the atmospheric pressure puanes the perfume up leading to the narrow aperture.

## 6. Venturi Relation

Consider a pipe within which a fluid of density $p$ is flowing through different areas of cross-section as shown in the Fig. 5.23.
Let $A_{1}$ be the cross-sectional area at wide end and $A_{2}$ be the cross-sectional area at narrow portion.
Suppose that $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ be the flow speeds at the wide and narrow portions respectively. Pressure $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ indicate the liquid pressure at both the portions by connecting the limbs of the
[Image removed]

Fig. 5.23: Venturi meter
manometer.

As the pipe is placed horizontally, therefore, we consider that average potential energy is the same at both places while using Bernoulli's equation.
Thus, Bernoulli's equation can be written as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& P_{1}+\frac{1}{2} p v_{1}^{2}=P_{2}-\frac{1}{2} p v_{2}^{2} \\
& \text { or } \quad P_{1}-P_{2}=\frac{1}{2} p v_{2}^{2}-\frac{1}{2} p v_{1}^{2} \\
& \text { or } \quad P_{1}-P_{2}=\frac{1}{2} p\left(v_{2}^{2}-v_{1}^{2}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

From the equation of continuity:

$$
\begin{aligned}
A_{1} v_{1} & =A_{2} v_{2} \\
v_{1} & =\frac{A_{2} v_{2}}{A_{1}}
\end{aligned}
$$

## 5. Solids and Fluid Dynamics

## 1. Interesting Information

It is clear from the result of Bernoulli's Equation for horizontal pipe that "where speed is high, the pressure will be low". Mathematicallily,

$$
P+\frac{1}{2} p v^{2}=\text { constant }
$$

or

$$
v_{1}=\frac{A_{2} v_{2}}{A_{1}}
$$

As the cross-sectional area $A_{2}$ is small as compared to the area $A_{1}$ as is clear from the figure, i.e. $A_{2}<A_{1}$. So, $v_{1}$ will be small as compared to $v_{2}$. Thus, the speed of the fluid is very slow in wider portion of the pipe as compared to the narrow portion, So, we can neglect $v_{1}$ on the right-hand side of Eq.(5.23). Hence

$$
P_{1}-P_{2}=\frac{1}{2} p v_{2}^{2}
$$

This is known as Venturi relation, which is used in venturi meter, a device used to measure speed of liquid flow.

## 7. Torricelli's Theorem

A simple application of Bernoulli's equation is shown in Fig. 5.24. Suppose a large tank of fluid has two small orifices $A$ and $B$ on it. Let us find the speed with which the water flows from the orifice $A$.
Since the orifices are so small, the efflux speeds $v_{2}$ and $v_{2}$ will be much larger than the speed $v_{1}$ of the top surface of water. We can therefore, take $v_{1}$ as approximately zero. Hence, Bernoulli's equation can be written as:

$$
P_{1}+p g h_{1}=P_{2}+\frac{1}{2} p v_{2}^{2}+p g h_{2}
$$

But

$$
P_{1}=P_{2}=\text { Atmospheric pressure }
$$

[Image removed]

Fig.5.24:
A tank containing fluid with a orifice.

Therefore, the above equation becomes:

$$
v_{2}=\sqrt{2 g\left(h_{1}-h_{2}\right)}
$$

This is Torricelli's theorem which states that:
The speed of efflux is equal to the velocity gained by the fluid in falling through the distance $\left(h_{1}-h_{2}\right)$ under the action of gravity.

Notice that the speed of the efflux of liquid is the same as the speed of a ball that falls through a height $\left(h_{1}-h_{2}\right)$. The top level of the tank has moved down a little and the P.E. has been transferred into $K . E$. of the efflux of fluid. If the orifice had been pointed upward at $B$ as shown in Fig.6.4, this $K . E$. would allow the liquid to rise to the level of water tank. In practice, viscous-energy losses would alter the result to some extent.

# 5.13 VISCOUS DRAG AND STOKES' LAW 

The frictional effect between different layers of a flowing fluid is described in terms of viscosity of the fluid. Viscosity measures, how much force is required to slide one layer of the liquid over another layer. Substances that do not flow easily, such as thick tar and honey, etc., have large coefficients of viscosity, usually denoted by Greek letter ' $\eta$ '. Substances which flow easily, like water, have small coefficient of viscosities. Since liquids and gases have non zero viscosity, therefore, a force is required if an object is to be moved through them. Even the small viscosity of the air causes a large retarding force on a car as it travels at high speed. If you stick out your hand out of the window of a fast moving car, you can easily recognize that considerable force has to be exerted on your hand to move it through the air. These are typical examples of the following fact.

An object moving through a fluid experiences a retarding force called a drag force. The drag force increases as the speed of the object increases.
Even in the simplesl cases, the exact value of the drag force is difficult to calculate. However, the case of a sphere moving through a fluid is of great importance.
The drag force $F$ on a sphere of radius $r$ moving slowly with speed $v$ through a fluid of viscosity $\eta$ is given by Stokes' law as under:

$$
F=6 \pi \pi r v
$$

However, at high speeds the force is no longer simply proportional to speed.

### 5.14 TERMINAL VELOCITY

[Image removed]

A chimney works best when it is tall and exposed to air currents, which reduces the pressure at the top and forces the upward flow of smoke.

Consider a water droplet having radius $r$ such as that of fog falling vertically, the air drag on the water droplet increases with speed. The droplet accelerates rapidly under the over powering force of gravity which pulls the droplet rapidly downward due to force of gravity. However, the upward drag force on it increases as the speed of the droplet

increases. The net force on the droplet is
Net force $=$ Weight - Drag force
As the speed of the droplet continues to increase, the drag force eventually approaches the weight in the magnitude. Finally, when the magnitude of the drag force becomes equal to the weight, the net force acting on the droplet is zero. Then the droplet will fall with constant speed called terminal velocity.
To find the terminal velocity $v$, in this case, we use Stokes' law for the drag force. Equating it to the weight of the drop, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 0=m g-6 \pi \eta r v_{1} \\
& v_{1}=\frac{m g}{6 \pi \eta r}
\end{aligned}
$$

The mass of the droplet is $\rho V$, where $V=\frac{4}{3} \pi r^{3}$ is the volume of the sphere.
Substituting above values in the Eq. (5.28), we have

$$
v_{1}=\frac{2 g r^{2} \rho}{9 \eta}
$$

(5.29)

Example 5.5 A tiny water droplet of radius 0.010 cm descends through air from a high building. Calculate its terminal velocity. Given that $\eta$ for air $=19 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ and density of water $p=1000 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}$.

$$
r=1.0 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~m}, \quad \rho=1000 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}, \quad \eta=19 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}
$$

Putting the above values in Eq. (5.29)

$$
v_{1}=\frac{2 \times 9.8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-3} \times\left(1.0 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~m}\right)^{2} \times 1000 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}}{9 \times 19 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}
$$

Terminal velocity $=1.1 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$.

# 5.15 REAL FLUIDS ARE VISCOUS FLUIDS 

## Ideal fluid

It is a fluid that does not have viscosity and cannot be compressed. This type of fluid cannot exist practically.

## Real fluid

All types of fluids that possess viscosity are termed as real fluids.
Examples: Kerosene oil, castor oil and honey etc.

## Comparison of Ideal and Real Fluids

An example of ideal fluid cannot be provided because it does not exist in the real world.

However, every fluid that we see around us like water, diesel, petrol, honey, etc. are real fluids. Moreover, differences in viscosity can be found in real life, for example, honey is more viscous than water. Bernoulli's equation states that the speed of fluid flow is increased as a result of a simultaneous decrease in the potential energy of the fluid or a decrease in the static pressure on the fluid. When a fluid is viscous, it essentially refers to the thickness of the fluid or the friction, the fluid faces while fluid flows. Therefore, ideal fluids do not face the opposing force and have a non-viscous flow, while real fluids have a viscous flow. Ideal fluids are incompressible. It is not also subjected to surface tension.

# 5.16 SUPERFLUIDS 

Superfluidity is the characteristic property of fluids with zero viscosity i.e., flow is frictionless. A substance exhibiting this property is a superfluid. Superfluids flow without loss of kinetic energy. They can flow through incredibly narrow spaces without any friction.

Superfluidity is achieved in some substances at extremely low temperature. For example, in fluid dynamics, a vortex is region in a fluid in which the flow revolves around an axial line, which may be straight or curved. The vortices are generally created at a moving boundary due to frictionless conditions. Vortices move with the fluid and dispersed by the action of viscosity.
Superfluid helium-4 is the most studied example of superfluidity. It changes from a liquid to a superfluids just a few degree below its boiling point of $-452^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ $\left(-289^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right.$ or 4 K$)$. Superfluids helium-4 moving as a normal clear liquid, but it has no viscosity. This means that once it starts to flow, it keeps moving past

## TIGBR

Perachutes increase air resistance (drag) by creating a large surface area, which counteracts the force of gravity. This slows down the persons fall, allowing them to land safely. any obstacles.

## Superfluidity Applications

Currently, there are few practical uses for superfluids. Superfluid helium-4 serves as a coolant for high-field magnets. Both helium-3 and helium-4 are utilized in advanced particle detectors. Researching superfluidity also helps us learn more about superconductivity.
Liquid helium is recognized for its great thermal conductivity and is used in cryogenic applications, including cooling superconducting magnets, scientific research, and medical uses. Additionally, it is employed in industry for leak testing and in the production of electronic and optical products.

# 6.1 ASSUMPTIONS OF THE KINETIC THEORY OF GASES 

The kinetic theory of gases is a fundamental theory in physics and chemistry that explains the behaviour of gases based on the motion of their constituent particles. This theory provides a macroscopic understanding of gas properties such as pressure, temperature, and volume. Thetnodynamics thus plays a key role in technology, since almost all the raw energy available for our use is liberated in the form of heat. In this chapter, we shall study the bebaviour of gases and laws of thermodynamics, their significance and applications.

### 6.1 ASSUMPTIONS OF THE KINETIC THEORY OF GASES

The kinetic theory of gases is a fundamental theory in physics and chemistry that explains the behaviour of gases based on the motion of their constituent particles. This theory provides a macroscopic understanding of gas properties such as pressure, temperature, and volume. Here are the key assumptions of the kinetic theory of gases.

## 1. Gas Particles are in Constant, Random Motion

Gas molecules are in perpetual, random motion. They move in straight lines until they collide with either another molecule or the walls of the container.

## 2. Negligible Volume of Gas Particles

The volume of the individual gas molecules is negligible as compared to the total volume of the gas. This means that the particles are considered point masses with no significant volume.

## 3. No Intermolecular Forces

There are no attractive or repulsive forces between the gas molecules. The particles do not exert any force on each other except during collisions.

## 4. Elastic Collisions

The collisions between gas molecules, and with the walls of the container are perfectly elastic. This means that there is no net loss of kinetic energy during collisions. The total kinetic energy is conserved.

## 5. Large Number of Particles

A gas contains a large number of particles. This large number allows for the use of statistical methods to describe the properties of the gas.

## 6. Average Kinetic Energy is Proportional to Temperature

The average kinetic energy of gas particles is directly proportional to the absolute temperature of the gas. This implies that as the temperature increases, the speed of the gas particles also increases.

## 7. Pressure due to Particle Collisions

The pressure exerted by a gas on the walls of its container is due to the collisions of gas

particles with the walls. The force exerted by the particles during collisions generates pressure.

# 8. Time of Collisions is Negligible 

The time interval of a collision between gas particles is extremely short compared to the time between collisions. This assumption simplifies the analysis of particle dynamics.

## Limitations of Kinetic Molecular Theory

## Real Gases

The assumptions of the kinetic theory hold true for ideal gases, but real gases exhibit deviations due to intermolecular forces and finite molecular volume, especially at high pressures and low temperatures.
In summary, the kinetic theory of gases provides a macroscopic view of gas behaviour, linking macroscopic properties like pressure and temperature to the motion of gas particles, and serves as a foundational concept in understanding thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.

## Equation of State for an Ideal Gas

A gas that obeys kinetic theory of gases is termed as an ideal gas. Ideal gas equation is given by

$$
P V=n R T \quad \ldots(6.1)
$$

Here $P$ represents pressure, $V$ is volume, $n$ is number of moles of the gas, $R$ is universal gas constant ( $R=8.3145 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1} \mathrm{~K}$ ) and $T$ is the absolute temperature.
Equation (6.1) implies that product of pressure and volume is directly proportional to the absolute temperature for an ideal gas.

## Real Gas to Behays Like an Ideal Gas

According to kinetic theory of gases, a gas has no intermolecular interaction and molecules are far apart from each other. For a real gas to behave like an ideal gas, some conditions must be satisfied. P.E. of the gas molecules is negligible and this have only K.E.

Number of moles ' $n$ 'can be given by

$$
n=\frac{\text { Mass of gas }}{\text { Molar mass of gas }}=\frac{m}{M}
$$

So, Eq. (6.1) becomes: $P V=\frac{m}{M} R T \quad$ or $\quad P M=\left(\frac{m}{V}\right) R T$
We know that density; $\rho=\frac{m}{V}, \quad$ So, $\quad \rho=\frac{P M}{R T}$ as $\frac{M}{R}$ is constant $\therefore \rho \propto \frac{P}{T}$
The density of a gas will be low at low pressure and high temperature due to which molecules of the gas will be at large distance from each other and the intermolecular

forces will be negligible. So, the real gas behaves like an ideal gas at low pressure and high temperature.

# Ideal Gas Equation in Terms of Boltzmann Constant 

From ideal gas equation:

$$
P V=n R T
$$

A mole can be defined as the number of atoms or molecules per unit Avogadro's number ( $N_{A}=6.02 \times 10^{20}$ ).

## Mathematically;

$$
n=\frac{N}{N_{A}}
$$

(ii) , N is number of atoms or molecules

Substituting Eq. (ii) in Eq. (i), we have

$$
P V=\frac{N}{N_{A}} R T
$$

The term $\frac{R}{N_{A}}$ is termed as Boltzmann constant $k_{B}$, i.e.,

$$
k_{B}=\frac{R}{N_{A}}
$$

(6.2)

For your information
Real gases approach ideal beheviour under:
(i) low pressure
(ii) high temperature

Substituting the values of $R$ and $N_{A}$ we have

$$
k_{B}=1.38 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~J} \cdot \mathrm{~K}^{-1}
$$

Substituting Eq. (6.2) in Eq. (iii),

$$
P V=N k_{B} T
$$

Equation (6.3) gives ideal gas equation in terms of Boltzmann constant $k_{B}$.
(1) Example 6.1 One mole of an ideal gas is at a temperature of 300 K . If the Boltzmann constant is $1.38 \times 10^{10} \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}$, calculate the volume of the gas at a pressure of 1 atom. [1atm $=101325 \mathrm{~Pa}]$
Solution We know that:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& P V=n R T \\
& R=N_{A} \times k_{B} \quad \text { where } k_{B}=\frac{R}{N_{A}} \\
& \text { Here } \quad V=\frac{n N_{A} k_{B} T}{P} \\
& \begin{array}{l}
V=\frac{1 \mathrm{~mol} \times 6.02 \times 10^{20} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1} \times 1.38 \times 10^{-22} \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \times 300 \mathrm{~K}}{101325 \mathrm{~Pa}} \\
V \approx 0.0245 \mathrm{~m}^{3}
\end{array}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, volume of gas would be $0.0245 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$.

# Gas Laws 

There are some variables (state functions) which describe quantity of gas which includes pressure, volume, and temperature ( $P, V$, and $T$ ) with change in one variable, the second variable changes while the third is kept constant. The laws that relate these variables mutually for an ideal gas are termed as gas laws.

## Boyle's Law

This law was introduced by Robert Boyle in 1662, and it provides a relationship between pressure and volume of a gas at constant temperature. It sates that for a fixed mass of an ideal gas, the pressure $P$ exerted by a gas varies inversely with volume $V$ occupied by the gas at constant temperature.
Mathematically;

$$
\begin{aligned}
& P \propto \frac{1}{V} \text { at constant } T \\
& P=\text { constant } \frac{1}{V} \text { or } P V=\text { constant }
\end{aligned}
$$

or $\quad P_{1} V_{1}=P_{2} V_{2}$
Graphical representation of Boyle's law is shown in Fig. 6.1.

## Charles' Law

Charles' law relates volume and temperature of an ideal gas for a fixed mass at constant pressure. This law was formulated in 1870 by a French Physicist Jacques Charles. It states that the volume of given mass of gas at constant pressure is directly proportional to the absolute temperature.
Mathematically;

$$
\begin{aligned}
& V \propto T \text { atconstant } P \\
& V \\
& T=\text { constant } \\
& \text { or } \\
& \frac{V_{1}}{T_{1}}=\frac{V_{2}}{T_{2}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Graphically, it can be shown in Fig. 6.2.

## Joseph lussac's Law

[Image removed]

Fig. 6.2

It states that for a fixed mass of an ideal gas, the pressure exerted by a gas varies directly with absolute temperature of the gas at constant volume.
Mathematically;

$$
\begin{aligned}
& P \propto T \text { at constant } V \\
& P=\text { constant } \times T
\end{aligned}
$$

# Thermal Equilibrium 

When two bodies are at the same temperature, the thermal energy (which is related to the kinetic energy of particles) of each body is equal. As a result, there is no driving force for heat transfer between them, and thus they remain in thermal equilibrium.

## Example

When we put a metal spoon into a hot cup of coffee:
(i) initially, the coffee is hotter than the spoon.
(ii) over time, heat flows from the coffee to the spoon.
(iii) eventually, the coffee and spoon reach at the same temperature.

Thermal equilibrium is achieved at this point, there is no net heat flow between the coffee and the spoon, and they are said to be in thermal equilibrium.

### 6.2 INTERNALENERGY

The sum of all forms of molecular energies (kinetic and potential) of a substance is termed as its internal energy. In the study of thermodynamics, usually ideal gas is considered as a working substance. The molecules of an ideal gas are mere mass points which exert no forces on one another. So, the internal energy of an ideal gas system is generally the translational $K . E$. of its molecules. Since the temperature of a system is defined as the average $K . E$ of its molecules, thus for an ideal gas system, the internal energy is directly proportional to its temperature.
According to the kinetic theory of gases, the average kinetic energy of gas molecules is given by
$<K . E>=\frac{3}{2} k_{a} T$ or $<\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}>=\frac{3}{2} k_{a} T$
where $k_{a}$ is Boltzmann constant.
Therefore, the rise in temperature of an object reflects an increase in the internal kinetic energy of its particles. This increase in internal energy can
[Image removed]

Different processes can lead to changes in internal energy and temperature, such as heating (adding heat), adiabatic compression or expansion (no heat exchange), or phase changes (where heat energy changes the state of matter without changing temperature).

occur due to the absorption of heat energy, which raises the average kinetic energy of the particles and thus increases the temperature of the object.

### 6.3 HEAT AND WORK

We know that both heat and work correspond to transfer of energy by some means. The idea was first applied to the steam engine where it was natural to transfer heat in and get work out. Consequently, it made a sense to define both heat in and work out as positive quantities. Hence, work done by the system on its environment is considered positive while work done on the system by the environment is taken as negative. If an amount of heat $Q$ enters the system, it could manifest itself as either an increase in internal energy or as a resulting quantity of work performed by the system on the surrounding or both.
We can express the work in terms of directly measurable variables. Consider the gas enclosed in the cylinder with a moveable, frictionless piston of cross-sectional area $A$ as shown in Fig.6.4(a). In equilibrium, the system occupies volume $V$ and exerts a pressure $P$ on the walls of the cylinder and its piston. The force $F$ exerted by the gas on the piston is $P A$.
We assume that the gas expands through $\Delta V$ very slowly, so that it remains in equilibrium as shown in Fig. 6.4(b). As the piston moves up through a small distance $\Delta y$, the work $W$ done by the gas is:
[Image removed]

The work done can also be calculated by area of the curve under $P-V$ graph as shown in Fig. 6.5.

## Chapter 6. Heat and Thermodynamics

Intramal energy is a function of state. Consequently, it does not depend on path but depends on initial and final states of the system. Thus, internal energy is similar to the gravitational P.E. So, like the potential energy, it is the change in internal energy and not its absolute value, which is important.
[Image removed]

Fig. 6.4
A gas is sealed in a cylinder by a weightless, frictioneless piston. The constant downward applied force $F$ equals $P A$, and when the piston is displaced, downward work is done on the gas.
[Image removed]

Fig. 6.5

Knowing the details of the change in internal energy and the mechanical work done, we are in a position to describe the general principles which deal with heat energy and its transformation into mechanical energy. These principles are known as laws of thermodynamics.

# 6.4 FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS 

When heat is added to a system there is an increase in the internal energy due to the rise in temperature, an increase in pressure or change in the state. If at the same time, a substance is allowed to do work on its environment by expansion, the heat $Q$ required will be the heat necessary to change the internal energy of the substance from $U_{1}$ in the first state to $U_{2}$ in the second state plus the work $W$ done on the environment.
Thus $\quad Q=\left(U_{2}-U_{1}\right)+W$
or $\quad Q=\Delta U+W$
Thus the change in internal energy $\Delta U=U_{2}-U_{1}$ is defined as $Q-W$. Since it is the same for all processes concerning the state, the first law of thermodynamics, thus can be stated as,

In any thermodynamic process, when heat $Q$ is added to a system, this energy appears as an increase in the internal energy $\Delta U$ stored in the system plus the work $W$ done by the system on its surroundings.

1. Conservation Principle: The underlying principle of the first law of thermodynamics is the conservation of energy. It asserts that while energy can change from one form to another (such as from chemical potential energy to thermal energy), the total energy in an isolated system remains constant over time.
2. Wider Applicability: Beyond mechanical systems, the first law of thermodynamics applies universally to all forms of energy and all types of processes, including chemical reactions, electrical systems, and nuclear reactions. It provides a foundational understanding that allows scientists and engineers to predict and understand energy transformations in various contexts.
The first law of thermodynamics expresses the law of conservation of energy by affirming that energy is a conserved quantity in isolated systems. It provides a framework to understand how energy is transferred and transformed within systems without violating the fundamental principle that energy neither be created nor be destroyed.
A bicycle pump is a good example of first law of thermodynamics. When we pump on the handle rapidly, it becomes hot due to mechanical work done on the gas, raising thereby its internal energy. One such simple arrangement is shown in Fig. 6.6. It consists of a bicycle pump with a blocked outlet.
[Image removed]

Fig. 6.6

A thermocouple connected through the blocked outlet allows the air temperature to be monitored. Thermocouple thermometer can detect a minute variation of the temperature. When the piston is rapidly pushed, thermometer shows a temperature rise due to increase of internal energy of the air. The push force does work on the air, thereby, increasing its internal energy, which is shown, by the increase in temperature of the air.
Human metabolism also provides an example of energy conservation. Human beings and other animals do work when they walk, run, or move. Work requires energy. Energy is also needed for growth to make new cells and to replace old cells that have died. Energy transforming processes that occur within an organism are named as metabolism. We can apply the first law of thermodynamics ( $\Delta U=Q-W$ ), to an organism of the human body. Work done will result in the decrease in internal energy of the body. Consequently, the body temperature or in other words internal energy is maintained by the food we eat.

Example 6.2 A gas is enclosed in a container fitted with a piston of cross-sectional area $0.10 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$. The pressure of the gas is maintained at $8000 \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~m}^{\infty}$. When heat is slowly transferred, the piston is pushed up through a distance of 4.0 cm . If 42 J heat is transferred to the system during the expansion, what is the change in internal energy of the system?

Solution The work done by the gas is

$$
\begin{aligned}
W=P \Delta V=P A \Delta y & =8000 \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~m}^{-2} \times 0.10 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \times 4.0 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~m} \\
& =32 \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~m}=32 \mathrm{~J}
\end{aligned}
$$

The change in internal energy is found from first law of thermodynamics

$$
\Delta U=Q-W=42 \mathrm{~J}-32 \mathrm{~J}=10 \mathrm{~J}
$$

# Isothermal Process 

It is a process which is carried out at constant temperature and hence the condition for the application of Boyle's law on the gas is fulfilled. Therefore, when gas expands or compresses isothermally, the product of its pressure and volume during the process remains constant. If $P_{1}, V_{1}$ are initial pressure and volume whereas $P_{2}, V_{2}$ are pressure and volume after the isothermal change takes place (Fig. 6.7-a), respectively, then

$$
P_{1} V_{1}=P_{2} V_{2}
$$

In case of an ideal gas, the P.E. associated with its molecules is zero, hence, the internal energy of an ideal gas depends only on its temperature, which in this case remains constant, therefore, $\Delta U=0$. Hence, the first law of thermodynamics reduces to

$$
Q=W
$$

[Image removed]

Thus if gas expands and does external work $W$, an amount of heat $Q$ has to be supplied to the gas in order to produce an isothermal change. Since transfer of heat from one

place to another requires time, hence, to keep the temperature of the gas constant, the expansion or compression must take place slowly. The curve representing an isothermal process is called an isotherm (Fig. 6.7-a).

# Adiabatic Process 

An adiabatic process is the one in which no heat enters or leaves the system. Therefore, $\Delta Q=0$ and the first law of thermodynamics gives:

$$
W=-\Delta U
$$

## Brain teacert

Why does the intemal energy of an ideal gas remain constant during isothermal expansion?

Thus, if the gas expands and does external work, it is done at the expense of the internal energy of its molecules and, hence, the temperature of the gas falls. Conversely, an adiabatic compression causes the temperature of the gas to rise becalue of the work done on the gas.
Adiabatic change occurs when the gas expands or comprased rapidly, particularly when the gas is contained in an insulated cylinder. The examples of adiabatic process are:
(i) The rapid escape of air from a burst tyre.
(ii) The rapid expansion and compression of air through which a sound wave is passing.
(iii) Cloud formation in the atmosphere.

As the temperature of the gas does not remain constant, so it has been seen that;

$$
P V^{\prime}=\text { constant }
$$

where $\gamma$ is the ratio of the molar specific heat of the gas at constant pressure to molar specific heat at constant volume ( $\gamma=\frac{C_{v}}{C_{v}}$ ). The curve representing an adiabatic process is called an adiabat (Fig.6.7-b).

### 6.5 REVERSIBLE AND IRREVERSIBLE PROCESSES

A reversible process is one which can be retraced in exactly reverse order, without producing any change in the surroundings. In the reverse process, the working substance passes through the same stages as in the direct process but thermal and mechanical effects at each stage are exactly reversed. If heat is absorbed in the direct process, it will be given out in the reverse process and if work is done by the substance in the direct process, work will be done on the substance in the reverse process. Hence, the working substance is restored to its original conditions.

A succession of events which brings the system back to its initial condition is called a cycle. A reversible cycle is the one in which all the changes are reversible.

Although no actual change is completely reversible but the processes of liquification and evaporation of a substance, performed slowly, are practically reversible. Similarly the

slow compression of a gas in a cylinder is reversible process as the compression can be changed to expansion by slowly decreasing the pressure on the piston to reverse the operation.

If a process cannot be retraced in the backward direction by reversing the controlling factors, it is an irreversible process.
[Image removed]

All changes which occur suddenly or which involve friction or dissipation of energy through conduction, convection or radiation are irreversible. An example of highly irreversible process is an explosion.

# 6.6 HEAT ENGINE 

A heat engine converts some thermal energy to mechanical work. Usually, the heat comes from the burning of a fuel. The earliest heat engine was the steam engine. It was developed on the fact that when water is boiled in a vessel covered with a lid, the steam inside tries to push the lid off showing the ability to do work. This observation helped to develop a steam engine.
The working principle of a heat engine is based on the conversion of heat energy into mechanical work through a cyclic process. Here is how a heat engine typically operates. The working principle of a heat engine involves the cyclic transfer of heat energy from a high temperature reservoir to a low temperature reservoir, with the objective of converting as much heat as possible into mechanical work. This process is governed by principles of thermodynamics and is essential in various applications where mechanical energy is required from heat sources.

### 6.7 SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS

First law of thermodynamics tells us that heat energy can be converted into equivalent amount of work, but it is silent about the conditions under which this conversion takes place. The second law is concerned with the circumstances in which heat can be converted into work and direction of flow of heat.
Before initiating the discussion on formal statement of the second law of thermodynamics, let us analyze briefly the factual operation of an engine. The engine or the system (Fig. 6.8) absorbs a quantity of heat $Q_{1}$ from the heat source at temperature $T_{1}$. It does work $W$ and expels heat $Q_{2}$ to low temperature reservoir at temperature $T_{3}$. As the
[Image removed]

Fig. 6.8
Schematic representation of a heat engine. The engine absorbs heat $Q_{1}$ from the hot reservoir, expels heat $Q_{1}$ to the cold reservoir and does work $W$.

working substance goes through a cyclic process, in which the substance eventually returns to its initial state, the change in internal energy is zero. Hence, from the first law of thermodynamics, net work done should be equal to the net heat absorbed, i.e.,

$$
W=Q_{1}-Q_{2}
$$

In practice, the petrol engine of a motor car extracts heat from the burning fuel and converts a part of this energy to mechanical energy or work and expels the rest to the atmosphere. It has been observed that petrol engines convert roughly $25 \%$ and diesel engines 35 to $40 \%$ available heat energy into work.
The second law of thermodynamics is a formal statement based on these observations. It can be stated in a number of different ways:
According to Lord Kelvin's statement based on the working of a heat engine:
It is impossible to devise a process which may convert heat, extracted from a single reservoir, entirely into work without leaving any change in the working system.
This means that a single heat reservoir, no matter how much energy it contains, cannot be made to perform any work. This is true for oceans and our atmosphere which contain a large amount of heat energy but cannot be converted into useful mechanical work. As a consequence of second law of thermodynamics, two bodies at different temperatures are essential for the conversion of heat into work. Hence, for the working of heat engine there must be a source of heat at a high temperature and a sink at low temperature to which heat may be expelled. The reason for our inability to utilize the heat contents of oceans and atmosphere is that there is no reservoir at a temperature lower than any one of the two.
[Image removed]

According to the Kelvin statement of the second law of thermodynamics, the process pictured here is impossible. Heat from a source at a single temperature cannot be converted entirely into work.

# 6.8 GARNOT ENGINE AND CARNOT'S THEOREM 

Sadi Carnot in 1824 described an ideal engine using only isothermal and adiabatic processes. He showed that a heat engine operating in an ideal reversible cycle between two heat reservoirs at different temperatures, would be the most efficient engine. A Carnot cycle using an ideal gas as the working substance is shown on PV diagram (Fig. 6.9). It consists of following four steps:

1. The gas is allowed to expand isothermally at temperature $T_{1}$ absorbing heat $Q_{1}$ from the hot

reservoir. The process is represented by the curve $A B$.
2. The gas is then allowed to expand adiabatically until its temperature drops to $T_{2}$. The process is represented by the curve $B C$.
3. The gas at this stage is compressed isothermally at temperature $T_{2}$ rejecting heat $Q_{2}$ to the cold reservoir. The process is represented by the curve CD.
4. Finally the gas is compressed adiabatically to restore its initial state at temperature $T_{1}$. The process is represented by the curve DA.
Thermal and mechanical equilibrium is maintained all the time so that each process is perfectly reversible. As the working substance returns to the initial state, there is no change in its internal energy i.e., $\Delta U=0$.
The net work done during one cycle equals to the area enclosed by the path $A B C D A$ of the $P V$ diagram. It can also be estimated from net heat $\Delta Q$ absorbed in one cycle.

$$
Q=Q_{1}-Q_{2}
$$

From $1^{\text {st }}$ law of thermodynamics:

$$
Q=\Delta U+W
$$

or

$$
W=Q_{1}-Q_{2} \quad(\therefore \Delta U=0)
$$

The efficiency $\eta$ of the heat engine is defined as:

$$
\eta=\frac{\text { Output (Work) }}{\text { Input (Energy) }}
$$

Thus

$$
\eta=\frac{Q_{1}-Q_{2}}{Q_{1}}
$$

The energy transfer in an isothermal expansion or compression turns out to be proportional to kelvin temperature. So $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ are proportional to kelvin temperatures $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ respectively and hence,

$$
\eta=\frac{T_{1}-T_{2}}{T_{1}}=1-\frac{T_{2}}{T_{1}}
$$

The efficiency is usually taken in percentage, in that case:
Percentage efficiency $=\left(1-\frac{T_{2}}{T_{1}}\right) \times 100$
Thus, the efficiency of Carnot engine depends on the temperature of hot and cold reservoirs. It is independent of the nature of working substance. The larger the temperature difference of two reservoirs, the greater is the efficiency. But it can never be one or $100 \%$ unless cold reservoir is at absolute zero temperature ( $T_{2}=0 \mathrm{~K}$ ).
Such reservoirs are not available and hence the maximum efficiency is always less than

one. Nevertheless, the Carnot cycle establishes an upper limit on the efficiency of all heat engines. No practical heat engine can be perfectly reversible and also energy dissipation is inevitable. This fact is stated in Camot's theorem:

No heat engine can be more efficient than a Carnot engine operating between the same two temperatures.

The Carnot's theorem can be extended to state that:
All Carnot's engines operating between the same two temperatures have the same efficiency, irrespective of the nature of working substance.
In most practical cases, the cold reservoir is near room temperature. So, the efficiency can only be increased by raising the temperature of hot reservoir. All real heat engines are less efficient than Carnot engine due to friction and other heat losses.

Example 6.3 The turbine in a steam power plant takes steam from a boiler at $427^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and exhausts into a low temperature reservoir at $77^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. What is the maximum possible efficiency?

Solution Maximum efficiency for any engine operating between temperatures $T$ and $T_{2}$ is

$$
\% \eta=\frac{T_{1}-T_{2}}{T_{1}} \times 100 \% \quad \text { where } \quad T_{1}=427+273=700 \mathrm{~K}
$$

and

$$
T_{2}=77+273=350 \mathrm{~K}
$$

so

$$
\eta=\frac{T_{1}-T_{2}}{T_{1}}=\frac{700 \mathrm{~K}-350 \mathrm{~K}}{700 \mathrm{~K}}=\frac{350 \mathrm{~K}}{700 \mathrm{~K}}=\frac{1}{2}=0.5 \quad \text { or } \% \eta=0.5 \times 100=50 \%
$$

# 6.9 REFRIGERATOR 

Refrigerator is a device which maintains the temperature of a body below that of its surrounding. It operates in a cyclic process but in reverse as that of the heat engine as shown in Fig.6.10. A refrigerator absorbs heat from a cold reservoir and gives it off to a hot reservoir. This shows that in a refrigerator, the work is done on the system while in a heat engine work is done by the system.
A refrigerator works on the basis of Clausius statement of second law of thermodynamics, i.e., a heat engine is operating in reverse. Heat $Q_{0}$ is drawn from Low Temperature Reservoir (LTR) $T_{1}$ by compressor and is thrown into High Temperature Reservoir (HTR) $T_{2}$ with the help of external work done. The heat rejected to HTR $\left(Q_{u}\right)$ is given by
[Image removed]

Fig. 6.10
A refrigerator transfers heat from a low-temperature compartment to higher-temperature surroundings with the help of external work. It is a heat engine operating in reverse order.

$$
Q_{c}+W=Q_{N} \text { or } W=Q_{N}-Q_{c}
$$

The main purpose of refrigerator is to extract as much heat $Q_{c}$ as possible from LTR with the expenditure of as little work Was possible.

# Coefficient of Performance of Refrigerator 

The ratio of heat removed from LTR $\left(Q_{c}\right)$ to the work done $(W)$ is called coefficient of performance of a refrigerator.
A better refrigerator will remove a greater amount of heat from inside the refrigerator for the expenditure of a smaller mechanical work or electrical energy. The coefficient of performance of a refrigerator can be given by

$$
E=\frac{Q_{c}}{W}=\frac{Q_{c}}{Q_{1}-Q_{c}}
$$

The coefficient of performance in terms of temperature, where $Q \neq T$ is:

$$
E=\frac{T_{1}}{T_{2}-T_{1}}
$$

## Example 6.4

A refrigerator has a coefficient of performance $\beta$. If temperature in the freezer is $-23^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, then what is the temperature at which it rejects the heat?

## Solution

Coefficient of performance

$$
E=8
$$

Temperature of cold reservoir (freezer) $T_{1}=-23^{\circ} \mathrm{C}=-23+273=250 \mathrm{~K}$
Temperature of hotreservoir (room) $T_{c}=$ ?
Coefficient of performance

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =T_{1} \\
& T_{2}-T_{1} \\
& 8=\frac{250 \mathrm{~K}}{T_{2}-250 \mathrm{~K}} \\
& 8\left(T_{c}-250 \mathrm{~K}\right)=250 \mathrm{~K} \text { or } \quad T_{2}-250 \mathrm{~K}=\frac{250 \mathrm{~K}}{8} \\
& T_{2}=31.25 \mathrm{~K}+250 \mathrm{~K}=281.25 \mathrm{~K}=8.25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}
\end{aligned}

### 6.10 ENTROPY

The concept of entropy was introduced into the study of thermodynamics by Rudolph Clausius in 1856 to give a quantitative basis for the second law. It provides another variable to describe the state of a system to go along with pressure, volume, temperature and internal energy. If a system undergoes a reversible process during which itabsorbs a quantity of heat $\Delta Q$ at absolute temperature $T$, then the increase in the state variable called entropy $S$ of the system is given by

$$
\Delta S=\frac{\Delta Q}{T}
$$

Like potential energy or internal energy, it is the change in entropy of the system which is important.
The change in entropy is positive when heat is added and negative when heat is removed from the system. Suppose an amount of heat $Q$ flows from a reservoir at temperature $T_{1}$ through a conducting rod to a reservoir at temperature $T_{2}$ when $T_{1}>T_{2}$. The change in entropy of the reservoir, at temperature $T_{1}$, which loses heat, decreases by $Q / T_{1}$ and of the reservoir at temperature $T_{2}$, which gains heat, increases by $Q / T_{2}$. As $T_{1}>T_{2}$, so $Q / T_{2}$ will be greater than $Q / T_{1}$, i.e. $Q / T_{2}>Q / T_{1}$.
Hence, net change in entropy $\left(\frac{Q}{T_{2}}-\frac{Q}{T_{1}}\right)$ is positive.
It follows that in all natural processes where heat flows from one system to another, there is always a net increase in entropy. This is another statement of $2^{\text {nd }}$ law of thermodynamics. It states that;

If a system undergoes a natural process, it will go in the direction that causes the entropy of the system plus the environment to increase.
It is observed that a natural process tends to proceed towards a state of greater disorder. Thus, there is a relation between entropy and molecular disorder. For example, an irreversible heat flow from a hot to a cold substance of a system increases disorder because the molecules are initially sorted out in hotter and cooler regions. This order is lost when the system comes to thermal equilibrium. Addition of heat to a system increases its disorder because of increase in average molecular speeds and therefore, the randomness of molecular motion. Similarly, free expansion of gas increases its disorder because the molecules have greater randomness of position after expansion than before. Thus, in both examples, entropy is said to be increased.
We can conclude that only those processes are probable for which entropy of the system increases or remains constant. The process for which entropy remains constant is a reversible process; whereas for all irreversible processes, entropy of the system increases.
Every time entropy increases, the opportunity to convert some heat into work is lost. For example, there is an increase in entropy when hot and cold waters are mixed. Finally, the warm water cannot be separated into a hot layer and a cold layer. There has been no loss of energy but some of the energy is no longer available for conversion into work. Therefore, increase in entropy means degradation of energy from a higher level where more work can be extracted to a lower level at which less or no useful work can be done. The energy in a sense is degraded, going from more orderly form to less orderly form, eventually ending up as thermal energy.
In all real processes where heat transfer occurs, the energy available for doing useful

work decreases, eventually, the entropy increases. Even if the temperature of some system decreases, thereby decreasing the entropy, it is at the expense of net increase in entropy for some other system. When all the systems are taken together as the universe, the entropy of the universe always increases.

Example 6.5 Calculate the entropy change when 1.0 kg ice at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ melts into water at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Latent heat of fusion of ice $L_{f}=3.36 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~kg}^{-1}$.

Solution $m=1 \mathrm{~kg}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
T & =0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}=273 \mathrm{~K} \\
L_{f} & =3.36 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~kg}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

As

$$
\Delta S=\frac{\Delta Q}{T}
$$

where

$$
\Delta Q=m L_{f}
$$

So

$$
\Delta S=\frac{m L_{f}}{T}
$$

Substituting the values

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Delta S=\frac{1.00 \mathrm{~kg} \times 3.36 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~kg}}{273 \mathrm{~K}} \\
& \Delta S=1.23 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{3}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, entropy increases as it changes to water. The increase in entropy in this case is a measure of increase in the disorder of water molecules that change from solid to liquid state.

We are well familiar with various types of waves such as water waves in the ocean and circular ripples formed on a still pool of water by rain drops. When a musician plucks a guitar string, sound waves are generated in air which reach our ears and produces sensation of music. The vast energy of the Sun, millions of kilometres away, is transferred to the Earth by light waves. In this chapter, we will discuss, formation, propagation and applications of different types of waves.

### 7.1 WAVES

A wave is a regular disturbance or variation that carries energy, which spreads out from the source. For example, energy is transferred from the Sun to the Earth in the form of light waves called electromagnetic waves. These waves can even travel through

vacuum. However, in a medium, energy is transferred due to the regular and repeated disturbances that travel through the medium, making its particles to move up and down or back and forth (to and fro). Imagine a stone thrown into a pond of water (Fig. 7.1).

- The stone produces a disturbance (ripple) that travels through the water (medium).
[Image removed]

Fig. 7.1: Reprosenting a travelling disturbance (ripple)

- The water particles move up and down about their mean positions, creating a repeating pattern known as wave that spreads out.
The displacement of a particle of a wave is its distance in a specified direction from its rest / equilibrium position. If the displacement is plotted along the $y$-axis and the time in the direction of energy travel along the $x$-axis, we get a waveform as shown in Fig. 7.2.
The waves can be described by the following parameters:

1. Amplitude (A): The maximum displacement of the wave (or particles of the medium) from its equilibrium position.
2. Frequency ( $f$ ): The number of oscillations or vibrations or cycles per second.
3. Wavelength ( $\lambda$ ) The distance between two consecutive similar points on the wave that are in phase.
[Image removed]

Fig. 7.2: Graphical description of a wave

# Interesting information 

[Image removed]
4. Period (T): The time taken by the wave to complete one oscillation or cycle. it is the reciprocal of the frequency $T=1 / f$.
5. Speed ( $v$ ): The speed at which the wave travels. If a wave crest moves one wavelength $\lambda$ in one period of oscillation $T$, the speed $v$ is given by $v=\lambda / T$ as $1 / T=f$, so $\quad v=f \lambda$
6. Phase ( $\theta$ ): The relative position of a point on the wave at a given time.

## Types of Waves

Waves have various forms, each with unique characteristics. A brief detail of different types of waves is given below:

# 1. Mechanical Waves 

These waves require a physical medium (solid, liquid, or gas) to propagate. Examples are water waves (ocean, lake, or pond ripples), sound waves (audible vibrations in air, water, or solids), seismic waves (earthquakes), etc.

## 2. Electromagnetic Waves

They do not require a medium to propagate and therefore, can travel through vacuum. Examples are radiowaves (wireless communication), Microwaves (cooking and heating), infrared waves (IR or heat radiation), Visible light (sunlight, lamp light), Ultraviolet waves (UV radiation), X-rays (medical imaging), Gamma rays (high-energy radiation), etc.

## 3. Quantum Waves

Quantum waves are associated with particles like electrons and photons. Examples are matter waves/particle waves (electron waves in atoms) or de-Broglie waves, photon waves (light quanta), etc.

## 4. Surface Waves

Surface waves propagate along surfaces or interfaces between two mediums. Examples are ocean surface waves (wind-driven waves), seismic surface waves, etc.

## Transverse and Longitudinal Waves

There are two main types of waves which are named as transverse waves and longitudinal waves. A transverse wave is one in which the vibrations of the particles are at right angles to the direction in which the energy of the wave is travelling whereas a longitudinal wave is one in which the direction of the vibration of the particles is along or parallel to the the direction in which the energy of the wave is travelling.
The transverse wave and longitudinal wave are illustrated in Figs. 7.3 (a and b), respectively.

### 7.2 PRINCIPLE OF SUPERPOSITION OF WAVES

If a particle of the medium is simultaneously acted upon by two waves, then the resultant displacement of the particle is the algebraic sum of their individual displacements. This is called principle of superposition.
In other words, the displacements of the individual waves are added together to form a new wave pattern as shown in Fig. 7.4 (a and b), respectively.
(i) If two waves, which overlap each other, have same phase, their resultant displacement will be:

where

$$
y_{1}=\text { amplitude of wave } 1
$$

$y_{2}=$ amplitude of wave 2
and
$y=$ resultant amplitude
Particularly, if $y_{1}=y_{2}$, then resultant displacement will be:

$$
y=2 y_{11} \text { or } y=2 y_{2}
$$

(ii) If two waves, which cross each other, have opposite phase, their resultant displacement will be:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& y=y_{1}+\left(-y_{2}\right) \\
& y=y_{1}-y_{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

[Image removed]
7.4 (a): Superposition of two waves of the same frequency which are exactly in phase.

Particularly, if $y_{1}=y_{2}$, then resultant displacement will be $y=0$. Thus, if a particle of a medium is simultaneously acted upon by $n$ waves such that its displacement due to each of the individual $n$ waves be $y_{1}, y_{2}, \ldots \ldots, y_{n}$, then the resultant displacement $y$ of the particle, under the simultaneous action of these $n$ waves is the algebraic sum of all the displacements, i.e.,

$$
y=y_{1}+y_{2}+\ldots \ldots \ldots+y_{n}
$$

This is called principle of superposition of waves. Methematically, this can also be represented as:

$$
y(x, t)=y_{1}(x, t)+y_{2}(x, t)+\ldots \ldots+y_{n}(x, t)
$$

where $y(x, t)$ is the resultant wave, whereas $y_{1}(x, t)$, $y_{2}(x, t), \ldots \ldots, y_{n}(x, t)$ are the individual waves.
In the context of waves, $y(x, t)$ represents the wave function or wave displacement at a given point $x$ and time $t$. It describes the shape of the wave and its evolution over time. The principle of superposition applies to linear waves or small amplitude waves.
[Image removed]

Principle of superposition of waves leads to many interesting phenomena:
(i) Two waves having same frequency and travelling in the same direction (Interference).
(ii) Two waves of slightly different frequencies and travelling in the same direction (Beats).
(iii) Two waves of equal frequency travelling in opposite direction (Stationary waves).

# Applications of the Principle of Superposition 

By applying the principle of superposition of waves, noise-cancelling headphones effectively eliminate unwanted noise, providing a more immersive and peaceful listening experience.

1. The headphones contain one or more microphones that capture ambient noise (like background chatter or engine rumble or any environmental noise).
2. The microphone sends the sound signals to an amplifier and a processing unit in the headphones.
3. The processing unit generates an "anti-noise" signal, which is the exact opposite of the ambient noise (in terms of amplitude and phase).
4. The anti-noise signal is then played through the headphones, along with the desired audio (like music or voice).
5. When the anti-noise signal meets the ambient noise, the two waves cancel each other out resulting in a much quieter listening experience.
Though the above example is an oversimplification of the situation, as noise-cancelling headphones use complex algorithms and multiple microphones to achieve optimal noise cancellation, the basic principle of superposition remains a fundamental concept in understanding how they work.

### 7.3 INTERFERENCE AND ITS TYPES

Superposition of two waves having the same frequency and travelling in the same direction results in phenomenon called interference.
[Image removed]

Fig. 7.5(a): An experimental setup to observe interference of sound waves.

Fig. 7.5 (b): Interference of sound waves
An experimental setup to observe interference effect of sound waves is shown in Fig. 7.5(a). Two loud speakers $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ act as two sources of harmonic sound waves of a fixed frequency produced by an Audio Generator (AG). Since the two speakers are driven from the same generator, therefore, they vibrate in phase. Such sources of waves are called coherent sources. A microphone attached to a sensitive Cathode Ray Oscilloscope (CRO) acts as a detector of sound waves. The CRO is a device to display

the input signal into waveform on its screen. The microphone is placed at various points, turn by turn, in front of the loud speakers as shown in Fig.7.5(b).

# Constructive Interference 

At points $P_{1}, P_{3}$ and $P_{2}$, we find that a compression meets a compression and a rarefaction meets a rarefaction. So, the displacement of two waves are added up at these points according to the principle of superposition and a large resultant displacement is seen on the CRO screen (Fig.7.5-c).
[Image removed]

Constructive Interference: Large displacement is displayed on the CRO screen
[Image removed]

Fig. 7.5(d):
Destructive Interference:
Zero displacement is displayed on the CRO screen
[Image removed]

Interference pattern produced by a thin soap film Illuminated by white light.

From Fig. 7.5 (b), we find that the path difference $\Delta S$ between the waves at the point $P_{1}$, is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Delta S=S_{2} P_{1}-S_{1} P_{1} \\
& \Delta S=4 \frac{1}{2} \lambda-3 \frac{1}{2} \lambda=\lambda
\end{aligned}
$$

Similarly, at points $P_{3}$ and $P_{2}$, path difference is zero and $\lambda$, respectively. Here, $\lambda$ is the wavelength which is the distance between any two successive solid or dashed lines.

Whenever the path difference is an integral multiple of wavelength, the two waves are added up. This effect is called constructive interference.
Therefore, the path difference (condition) for constructive interference can be written as:

$$
\Delta S=n \lambda \quad \text { where } n=0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \ldots \ldots
$$

## Destructive Interference

At points $P_{2}$ and $P_{4}$, a compression meets a rarefaction, so that they cancel each other's effect according to the principle of superposition. The resultant displacement becomes zero, as shown in Fig. 7.5(d).
The path difference $\Delta S$ between the waves at points $P_{3}$ and $P_{4}$ is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Delta S=S_{2} P_{2}-S_{1} P_{2} \\
& \Delta S=4 \lambda-3 \frac{1}{2} \lambda=\frac{1}{2} \lambda
\end{aligned}
$$

Similarly, at $P$, the path difference is $\frac{1}{2} \lambda$.
So, at points where the displacements of two waves cancel each other's effect, the path difference is an odd integral multiple of half the wavelength. This effect is called destructive interference.
Therefore, the path difference (condition) for destructive interference can be written as:

$$
\Delta S=(2 n+1) \lambda / 2 \quad \text { where } n=0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3
$$

Example 7.1 Two speakers are arranged as shown in the figure. The distance between them is 3.0 m and they emit a constant tone of 344 Hz . A microphone $P$ is moved along a line parallel to and 4.0 m from the line connecting the two speakers. It is found that tone of maximum loudness is heard and displayed on the CRO when microphone is on the centre of the line and directly opposite to each speaker. Calculate the speed of sound.
[Image removed]

For tone of maximum loudness or the condition for constructive interference, the path difference must be $0, \pm 1 \lambda, \pm 2 \lambda, \pm 3 \lambda, \ldots$
At middle point ' $O$ ' the path difference between two sound waves is zero ( $\mathrm{S}, \mathrm{O}=\mathrm{S}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ ), thus at that point ' O ' constructive interference takes place.
For the next point $P$ of constructive interference, the path difference between waves should be $\lambda$. So, $\sqrt{ } \lambda=$ Path difference $=S_{2} P_{1}-S_{1} P_{1}$
Now, we calculate values of $S_{2} P_{1}$ from right angle triangle $S_{1} S_{2} P_{1}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& S_{2} P_{1}=\sqrt{\left(S_{1} S_{2}\right)^{2}+\left(S_{1} P_{1}\right)^{2}} \quad \text { (By PythagorasTheorem) } \\
& S_{2} P_{1}=\sqrt{(3 m)^{2}+(4 m)^{2}}=\sqrt{(9+16)} m=\sqrt{25} \mathrm{~m}=5 \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore

$$
\lambda=S_{2} P_{1}-S_{1} P_{1} \quad \text { or } \quad \lambda=5 m-4 m=1 m
$$

This is the path difference for constructive interference.
As

$$
v=f \lambda
$$

Putting the values, we have

$$
v=344 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1} \times 1 \mathrm{~m}=344 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}
$$

# Physica II 

Example 7.2 The wavelength of a signal from a radio transmitter is 1500 m and the frequency is 200 kHz . What is the wavelength for a transmitter operating at 1000 kHz and with what speed the radiowaves travel?

## Solution

$\lambda_{1}=1500 \mathrm{~m}=1.5 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~m}, \quad f_{1}=200 \mathrm{kHz}=2.0 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~Hz}$ $f_{2}=1000 \mathrm{kHz}=1 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~Hz}, \lambda_{2}=?, v=?, \mathrm{As} v=f \lambda$ Since, the speed of both the signals is same, so

$$
\begin{aligned}
& v=f_{1} \lambda_{1} \\
& v=2.0 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~Hz} \times 1500 \mathrm{~m} \\
& v=3.0 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\
& v=f_{2} \lambda_{2} \\
& \lambda_{2}-\frac{v}{f_{2}} \\
& \lambda_{2}=\frac{3 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}{1 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~Hz}} \\
& \lambda_{2}=3 \times 10^{2} \mathrm{~m}

## 7.4 STATIONARY WAVES \& THEIR FORMATION

Stationary waves, also known as standing waves, are the waves that oscillate in a fixed position, without moving or propagating. They are formed by the superposition of two waves with the same frequency and amplitude, travelling in opposite directions. The resulting wave pattern remains stationary, with nodes (points of zero amplitude) and antinodes (points of maximum amplitude) at fixed positions. Examples include waves on a string, and sound waves in a pipe. The term "standing wave" describes that the wave pattern remains fixed in space, oscillating between positive and negative values, without moving forward or backward.
Let us consider the superposition of two waves moving along a string in opposite directions. Figures 7.6 (a) and (b) show the profile of two such waves at instants $t=0, T / 4, T / 2,3 / 4 T$ and $T$, where $T$ is the time period of the wave. We are interested in finding out the displacements of the points $1,2,3,4,5,6$ and 7 at these instants as the waves superpose. It is obvious that the points $1,2, . ., 7$ are distant $\lambda / 4$ apart, $\lambda$ being the wavelength of the waves. We can determine the resultant displacement of these points by applying the principle of superposition.
Figure 7.6 (c) shows the resultant displacement of the points 1,3,5 and 7 at the instants $t=0, T / 4, T / 2,3 T / 4$ and $T$. It can be seen that the resultant displacement of these points is always zero. These points of the medium are known as nodes. Here, the distance between two consecutive nodes is $\lambda / 2$.

[Image removed]

Fig. 7.6: Stationary waves
Figure 7.6 (d) shows the resultant displacement of the points 2,4 and 6 at the instants $t=0,7 / 4,7 / 2,37 / 4$ and $T$. The figure shows that these points are moving with an amplitude which is the sum of the amplitudes of the component waves represented by arrows. These points are known as antinodes. They are situated midway between the nodes and are $1 / 2$ apart. The distance between a node and the next antinode is $1 / 4$. Such a pattern of nodes and antinodes is known as a stationary or standing wave.
Energy in a wave transfers because of the motion of the particles of the medium. The nodes always remain at rest, so energy cannot flow past these points. Hence, energy remains "standing" in the medium between nodes, although it alternates between potential and kinetic forms at the antinodes. When the antinodes are all at their extreme displacements, the energy atored is wholly potential and when they are simultaneously passing through their equilibrium positions, the energy is wholly kinetic.

# 7.5 STATIONARY WAVES ON A STRETCHED STRING 

Consider a string of length $\ell$ which is kept stretched by clamping its ends so that the tension in the string is $F$.

## (a) String Plucked at its Middle Point

If the string is plucked at its middle point, two transverse waves will originate from this point. One of them will move towards the left end of the string and the other towards the right end. When these waves reach the two clamped ends, they are reflected back thus giving rise to stationary waves. As the two ends of the string are clamped, no motion will take place there. So, nodes will be formed at the two ends and one mode of vibration of the string will be as shown in Fig.7.7(a) with the two ends as nodes with one antinode in between. Visually, the string seems to vibrate in one loop. As the distance between two
[Image removed]

Fig. 7.7(a): First mode of vibration

consecutive nodes is one half of the wavelength of the waves set up in the string, so in this mode of vibration, the length $\ell$ of the string is

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \ell=\lambda_{1} / 2 \\
& \lambda_{1}=2 \ell
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\lambda_{1}$ is the wavelength of the waves set up in this mode. The speed $v$ of the waves in the string depends upon the tension $F$ of the string and $m$, the mass per unit length of the string. It is independent of the point from where string is plucked to generate wave. It is given by

$$
v=\frac{F}{m}
$$

Knowing the speed $v$ and wavelength $\lambda_{1}$, the frequency $f_{1}$ of the waves is:

$$
f_{1}=\frac{v}{\lambda_{1}}=\frac{v}{2 \ell}
$$

Substituting the value of $v$,

$$
f_{1}=\frac{1}{2 \ell} \cdot \frac{F}{m}
$$

Thus, in the first mode of vibration shown in Fig. 7.7 (a), waves of frequency $f_{1}$ only will be set up in the given string.

# (b) String Plucked at Quarter Length 

If the same string is plucked from one quarter of its length, again stationary waves will be set up with nodes and antinodes as shown in Fig. 7.7 (b). Note that now the string vibrates in two loops. This particular configuration of nodes and antinodes has developed because the string was plucked from the position of an antinode. As the distance between two consecutive nodes is half the wavelength, so the length $\ell$ of string is equal to the wavelength of the waves set up in this mode. If $\lambda_{2}$ is the measure of wavelength of these waves, then,
[Image removed]

Comparison of Eq. (7.5) with Eq. (7.1) shows that the wavelength in this case is half of that in the first case. Equation (7.2) shows that the speed of the waves depends on tension and mass per unit length of the string, it is independent of the point where the string is plucked. So, speed $v$ remains the same in both cases.
If $f_{2}$ is frequency of vibration of string in its second mode, then

$$
f_{2}=\frac{v}{\lambda_{2}}
$$

strings is varied by tightening the pegs on the neck of the instrument. Once the instrument is tuned, the musicians vary the frequency by moving their fingers along the neck, thereby changing the length of the vibrating portion of the string.

# Harmonics 

In the above example, the set of all the possible standing waves, having frequencies $f_{1}$, $2 f_{1}, 3 f_{1}, \ldots, n f_{1}$, are called harmonics of the system. The lowest or fundamental frequency of all the harmonics is called the fundamental or first harmonic. Subsequent frequencies are called as second harmonic, third harmonic, etc.

Example 7.3 A stationary wave is established in a string which is 120 cm long and fixed at both ends. The string vibrates in four segments; at a frequency of 120 Hz . Determine its wavelength and the fundamental frequency?

Solution

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \ell=120 \mathrm{om}=\frac{120}{100} \mathrm{~m}=1.2 \mathrm{~m} \\
& n=4 \\
& f_{4}=120 \mathrm{~Hz} \\
& f_{1}=? \\
& \lambda=?
\end{aligned}
$$

(i) As the string vibrates in four segments and the distance between two consecutive nodes is $2 / 2$, so the wavelength of the string is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \ell=n \frac{\lambda_{n}}{2} \\
& \lambda_{n}=\frac{2 \ell}{n} \\
& \lambda_{4}=\frac{2 \times 1.2 \mathrm{~m}}{4} \\
& \lambda_{4}=0.6 \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}
$$

(ii) If string vibrates in $n$ loops, then frequency of stationary waves will be:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& f_{n}=n f_{1} \\
& f_{4}=4 f \\
& 120 \mathrm{~Hz}=4 f_{1} \\
& f_{1}-\frac{120 \mathrm{~Hz}}{4} \\
& f=30 \mathrm{~Hz}
\end{aligned}
$$

### 7.6 STATIONARY WAVES IN AIR COLUMNS

Stationary waves can be set up in other media also, such as air column inside a pipe or tube. A common example of vibrating air column is in the organ pipe.

# Organ pipe 

An organ pipe is a wind instrument in which sound is produced, due to setting up of stationary waves in air column. It consists of a hollow long tube with both ends open or with one end open and the other closed. The relationship between the incident wave and the reflected wave depends upon whether the reflecting end of the pipe is open or closed.
(I) If the reflecting end is open, the air molecules have complete freedom of motion and this behaves as an antinode.
(ii) If the reflecting end is closed, then it behaves as a node because the movement of the molecules is restricted.

## Modes of Vibrations

Stationary longitudinal waves occur in a pipe as discussed by the following two cases:

## Case (1): Modes of vibrations in an organ pipe open at both ends

Let us consider an organ pipe of length $\ell$ which is open at both ends. As at the open end, an air molecule has complete freedom of motion so it acts as antinode as shown in Fig.7.8. In this figure, longitudinal waves set up inside the pipe have been represented by transverse curved lines which represent the displacement and amplitude of vibration of air particles at various points along the axis of pipe.

## (a) Fundamental mode of vibration

In this case, as shown in Fig. 7.8 (a), there is only one node N at the middle of the pipe. As both ends of pipe are open, there are two antinodes at both the ends. If $\lambda_{1}$ is the wavelength of sound, then
or

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \ell=\frac{\lambda_{1}}{4} \frac{\lambda_{1}}{4} \\
& \ell=\frac{\lambda_{1}}{2} \\
& \text { or } \quad \lambda_{1}=2 \ell
\end{aligned}
$$

If $f_{1}$ is the frequency of sound, then the velocity of sound is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& v=f_{1} \lambda_{1} \\
& f_{1}=v / \lambda_{1}
\end{aligned}
$$

Putting the value of $\lambda_{1}$, we have
[Image removed]

Fig. 7.8:
Stationary longitudinal waves in a pipe open at both ends.

$$
f_{1}=v / 2 \ell
$$

This frequency is called fundamental frequency or first harmonic.

## (b) Second mode of vibration

If there are three antinodes and two nodes, frequency will be twice that of fundamental

frequency. It is second mode of vibration as shown in Fig.7.8 (b). In this case, there are three antinodes and two nodes.
If $\lambda_{0}$ is the wavelength of sound, then

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \ell=\frac{\lambda_{2}}{4}+\frac{\lambda_{2}}{2}+\frac{\lambda_{2}}{4} \\
& \ell=(1+2+1) \quad \frac{\lambda_{2}}{4} \\
& \text { or } \quad \lambda_{2}=\ell
\end{aligned}
$$

If $f_{2}$ is the frequency of sound, then speed $v$ of sound becomes:

$$
v=f_{2} \lambda_{2}
$$

or

$$
f_{2}=\frac{v}{\lambda_{2}}
$$

Putting the value of $\lambda_{2}$, we have

$$
f_{2}=\frac{v}{\ell}
$$

or

$$
f_{2}=2 f_{1} \quad\left(\because \frac{v}{2 \ell}=f_{1}\right)
$$

## (c) nth mode of vibration

Similarly, frequency for air column vibrating in $n$ loops is:

$$
f_{n}=n(v / 2 \ell)
$$

and wavelength is

$$
\lambda_{2}=\frac{2 \ell}{n}
$$

where

$$
n=1,2,3,4,5
$$

So, the longitudinal stationary waves have a discrete set of frequencies $f_{1}, 2 f_{1}, 3 f_{2}, \ldots, n f_{n}$, which is known as harmonic series. The frequency $f_{1}$ is known as fundamental frequency and the others are called harmonics.

## Case (2): Modes of vibration in an organ pipe closed at one end

Let us consider an organ pipe of length $\ell$ which is closed at one end. Then at the closed end, we get a node while at the open end, we get an antinode as shown in the Fig. 7.9.

## (a) Fundamental mode of vibration:

Fundamental mode of vibration has one node and one antinode as shown in Fig.7.9 (a). If $\lambda_{1}$ is the wavelength of fundamental mode, then length of the pipe is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \ell=\frac{\lambda_{1}}{4} \\
& \lambda_{1}=4 \ell
\end{aligned}
$$

# Physics II 

So, the speed $v$ becomes:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& v=f_{1} \lambda \\
& f_{1}=\frac{v}{\lambda_{1}} \\
& f_{1}=\frac{v}{4 \ell} \quad\left(\because \lambda_{1}=4 \ell\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

The frequency $f_{1}$ is called fundamental frequency.

## (b) Second Mode of Vibration:

Second mode of vibration contains two nodes and two anti-nodes as shown in Fig.7.9 (b).
If $\lambda_{2}$ is the wavelength, then length of the pipe is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \ell=\frac{\lambda_{1}}{4}+\frac{\lambda_{2}}{2} \\
& \ell=\frac{3}{4} \lambda_{3} \\
& \lambda_{3}=\frac{4 \ell}{3} \\
& f_{3}=\frac{v}{\lambda_{3}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Putting value of $\lambda_{3}$, we have $v=f_{3} \lambda_{3}$
or

$$
f_{3}=\frac{v}{4 \ell}
$$

so

$$
f_{3}=3 f_{1}
$$

$$
\left[\because \frac{v}{4 \ell}=f_{1}\right]
$$

This is called second harmonic.

## (c) nth mode of vibration

If air column vibration in $n$ loops, then frequency $f_{n}$ is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& f_{n}=n\left(\frac{v}{4 \ell}\right) \\
& f_{n}=n f_{1} \quad \text { where } n=1,3,6, \ldots
\end{aligned}
$$

and the wavelength $\lambda_{n}$ is:

$$
\lambda_{n}=\frac{4 \ell}{n}
$$

By studying both cases, we conclude that the pipe which is open at both ends is richer in harmonics than that of closed at one end.
[Image removed]

In an organ pipe, the primary driving mechanism is wavering, sheet like jet of air from fluts-sit, which interacts with the upper lip and the air column in the pipe to maintain a steady oscillation.

Example 7.4 An organ pipe has a length of 50 cm . Find the frequency of its fundamentalnote and thenext harmonic, when it is:
(a) open at both ends
(b) closed at one end
(Speed of sound $=350 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ )
Solution $\quad t=50 \mathrm{~cm}=\frac{50}{100} \mathrm{~m}=0.5 \mathrm{~m}$

# Pander upent 

a) When pipe is open at both ends:

Fundamental frequency $\quad f_{1}=$ ?
Nextharmonic frequency $\quad f_{2}=$ ?
The frequency for $n$th harmonia in an open organ pipels:

$$
f_{1}-n \frac{v}{2 t} \quad \text { when } n=1,2,3, \ldots \ldots
$$

so the fundamental frequency is,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& f_{1}=\frac{1 \times 350 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}{2 \times 0.5 \mathrm{~m}} \quad \text { put } n=1 \\
& f_{1}=350 \mathrm{~Hz}
\end{aligned}
$$

Next harmonic frequency i.e., $n=2$ is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& f_{2}=\frac{2 v}{2 t} \\
& f_{2}=\frac{v}{t}=\frac{350 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}{0.5 \mathrm{~m}}=700 \mathrm{~s} \\
& f_{2}=700 \mathrm{~Hz}
\end{aligned}
$$

b) When pipe is closed at one end:

Fundamental frequency $\quad f_{1}=$ ?
Nextharmonio frequency $\quad f_{2}=$ ?
When the pipe is closed at one end, then frequency for nth harmonic is

$$
f_{n}-n \frac{v}{4 t} \quad \text { when } n=1,3,5,7 \ldots \ldots
$$

So fundamental frequency is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& f_{1}=\frac{1 \times 350 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}{4 \times 0.5 \mathrm{~m}} \quad \text { putting } n=1 \\
& f_{1}=175 \mathrm{~Hz}
\end{aligned}
$$

Next harmonic frequency i.e., $n=3$ is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& f_{3}=\frac{3 v}{4 \ell} \\
& f_{1}=\frac{3 \times 350 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}{4 \times 0.5 \mathrm{~m}} \\
& f_{y}=525 \mathrm{~Hz}
\end{aligned}
$$

Example 7.5 A church organ consists of pipes, each open at one end, of different lengths. The minimum length is 30 mm and the longest is 4 m . Calculate the frequency range of the fundamental notes. (Speed of sound $=340 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ )

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Solution } \quad \ell_{\text {min }}=30 \mathrm{~mm}=\frac{30}{1000} \mathrm{~m}=30 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m} \\
& \ell_{\text {max }}=4 \mathrm{~m} \\
& v=340 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

Frequency range $=$ ?
For an organ pipe open at one end only:

$$
f_{n}=\frac{n v}{4 \ell}
$$

(i) Minimum length

For fundamental frequency, put $n=1$

$$
f_{1, \text { min }}=\frac{n v}{4 \ell_{\text {min }}}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& f_{1, \text { min }}=\frac{1 \times 340 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}{4 \times 30 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m}} \\
& f_{\text {max }}=2833.33 \mathrm{~Hz}
\end{aligned}
$$

(ii) Maximum length:

For fundamental frequency, put $n=1$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& f_{\text {tmin }}-\frac{n v}{4 \ell_{\text {max }}} \\
& f_{\text {min }}=\frac{1 \times 340 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}{4 \times 4 \mathrm{~m}} \\
& f_{\text {min }}=21.25 \mathrm{~Hz}
\end{aligned}
$$

So, the fundamental frequency range is approximately from 21 Hz to 2833 Hz .

# 7.7 EXPERIMENT DEMONSTRATING STATIONARY WAVES USING MICROWAVES 

Microwaves are a form of electromagnetic radiations. They are called "micro" waves because their wavelengths are typically of the order of millimetres or centimetres, much shorter than radiowaves. Stationary waves, also known as standing waves, can be produced by microwaves when they are confined to a specific region or cavity such as wave guides or resonant chambers. In these structures, microwaves can bounce back and forth, creating a standing wave pattern with nodes and antinodes. It occurs when the microwave frequency matches the resonant frequency of the cavity.
The stationary waves can be created using microwaves by the following simple method as shown in Fig. 7.10.

## Structure of Microwave Oven

[Image removed]

Fie. 7.10. Experimental setup for stationary waves using microwave
The experiment setup consists of a microwave source (transmitter), a probe detector and a metal reflector (a metallic plate for the reflection of microwave). Three of the mentioned are placed in line.
The waves coming out of microwave source are moving towards the metal plate and then reflected back. The reflected wave and incident wave superpose and create a stationary wave pattern. This can be detected by a probe detector placed between transmitter and metallic plate. The intensity of the signal can be observed by the detector. You can move the plate or detector to observe antinode and node. By finding the distance from one antinode to the next antinode, the wavelength of stationary wave can be found.

# 7.8 DIFFRACTION OF WAVES 

Diffraction of waves is the bending of waves around the sharp edges or comers of obstacles or the spreading of waves beyond a barrier. It occurs when a wave encounters a physical barrier or an opening (a slit) that is comparable in size to the wavelength of the wave. The longer the wavelength, the greater the spreading and vice versa.
Diffraction can be observed in various types of waves, including water waves, sound waves, light waves and electromagnetic waves.
Some examples of the phenomenon of diffraction include:

- Hearing of sound waves around comers or through door way from where they were generated as sound waves bend around the comers.
- Diffraction of X-rays by crystals as the spacing between the regular arrays of atoms is of the order of X-rays wavelength.
Diffraction is a fundamental aspect of wave behaviour and has many practical applications in various fields.


## The Ripple Tank

Figure 7.11 shows a ripple tank. It is a very useful apparatus not only to generate water waves, but also to demonstrate wave properties (such as reflection, diffraction and refraction).
[Image removed]

Fig. 7.11: A ripple tank
Ripple tank contains water, vibrator (e.g. a motorized oscillating needle), obstacles (e.g. a small rectangular block or a semicircular barrier) and gap widths of different sizes. It creates a series of concentric circles

or parallel waves using the vibrator. An obstacle is placed for creating a gap with a specific width. The experiment can be repeated with differentgap widths. It is observed that when the gap width is small compared to the wavelength, diffraction is significant and the waves bend around the obstacle, creating a semicircular pattern. As the gap width increases relative to wavelength, diffraction decreases and the waves pass through the gap with less bending.
[Image removed]

This experiment demonstrates the qualitative effect of gap width on diffraction in a ripple tank, illustrating how the relationship between gap width and wavelength affects wave behaviour.

# Example 7.6 

In a ripple tank, a wave generator produces 500 pulses in 10 s . Find the frequency at time period of the pulses produced?
Solution $n-500$ pulses, $t=10 \mathrm{~s}, f=$ ?
As Frequency $=\frac{\text { Number of pulses }}{\text { Time }}$

$$
f=\frac{500}{10 \mathrm{~s}}=50 \mathrm{~Hz}
$$

We know that: $\quad T-\frac{1}{f}=\frac{1}{50 \mathrm{~Hz}}$

$$
T=0.02 \mathrm{~s}
$$

### 7.9 BEATS

When two waves of slightly different frequencies, travelling in the same direction overlap each other then there is a periodic variation of sound between maximum and minimum loudness which is called as beats.
Tuning forks give out pure notes (single frequency). If two tuning forks $A$ and $B$ of the same frequency say 32 Hz are sounded separately, they will give out pure notes. If they are sounded simultaneously, it will be difficult to differentiate the notes of one tuning fork from that of the other. The sound waves of the two will be superposed on each other and will be heard by the human ear as a single pure note.
If the tuning fork B is loaded with some wax or plasticine, its frequency will be lowered slightly, say it becomes 30 Hz . If now the two tuning forks are sounded together, a note of alternately increasing and decreasing intensity will be heard. This note is called beat note or a beat which is due to interference between the sound waves from tuning forks $A$ and $B$.

# Physics II 

Fig. 7.13 (a) shows the waveform of the note emitted from a tuning fork A. Similarly, Fig. 7.13(b) shows the waveform of the note emitted by tuning fork B. When both the tuning forks $A$ and $B$ are sounded together, the resultant waveform is shown in Fig. 7.12(c). It shows how do the beat note occur. At some instant $X$, the displacement of the two waves is in the same direction. The resultant displacement is large and a loud sound is heard.
After $1 / 4 \mathrm{~s}$ the displacement of the wave due to one tuning fork is opposite to the displacement of the wave due to the other tuning fork resulting in minimum displacement at $Y$, hence, faint sound or no sound is heard.
[Image removed]

Fig. 7.13: Formation of beats

Another $1 / 4 \mathrm{~s}$ later, the displacements are again in the same direction and a loud sound is heard again at $Z$.
Thus, during one second, we observe two faintest sounds or two loudest. As the difference of the frequency of the two tuning forks is also 4 Hz so, we find that the number of beats per second is equal to the difference between the frequencies of the tuning forks.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& f_{n}=32 \mathrm{~Hz}, \quad f_{a}=30 \mathrm{~Hz} \quad f_{n}>f_{a} \\
& \text { No. of beats }=f_{n}-f_{a}=32 \mathrm{~Hz}-30 \mathrm{~Hz}=2
\end{aligned}
$$

However, when the difference between the frequencies of the two sounds is more than 10 Hz , it becomes difficult to recognize the beats.
[Image removed]

The difference between the frequencies of the two waves is termed as beal frequency $f_{\text {w }}$.
One can use beats to tune a string instrument, such as piano or violin, by beating a note against a note of known frequency. The string can then be adjusted to the desired frequency by tightening or loosening it until no beats are heard.

# Tuning Musical Instruments 

Here are some examples of how beats are generated In musical instruments:

1. Guitar: When playing two strings with slightly different tunings, beats are created. For example, playing a standard tuned string and a string tuned a few cents higher or lower.
2. Piano: Playing two keys white and black, adjacent to each other, creates beats.
3. Violin: When playing two strings with slightly different bow pressures or speeds, beats are generated.
4. Drums: When two drums with slightly different tunings are played simultaneously, beats are created.
5. Flute: When playing two notes with slightly different embouchure (lip and facial muscles) positions, beats are generated.
6. Organ: When playing two pipes with slightly different tunings, beats are created.
7. Synthesizer: Generating two oscillators with slightly different frequencies creates beats.

In each of these examples, the slight difference in frequency between the two sound sources creates a periodic increase and decrease in amplitude, resulting in a "beat" or pulsation effect.

Musicians often use beats intentionally to create interesting rhythmic effects, add texture, or produce a sense of tension and release. However, In some cases, beats can be unwanted and may require adjustments to tuning, pitch, or playing technique to minimize their impact.

# Physics II 

Example 7.7 Two tuning forks exhibit beats at a beat frequency of 3 Hz . The frequency of one fork is 256 Hz . Its frequency is then lowered slightly by adding a bit of wax to one of its prongs. The two forks then exhibit a beat frequency of 1 Hz . Determine the frequency of the second tuning fork.

Solution Frequency of first tuning fork $=f_{1}=256 \mathrm{~Hz}$
Beat frequency before loading $=3 \mathrm{~Hz}$
Beat frequency after loading $=1 \mathrm{~Hz}$
Frequency of second tuning fork $=f_{2}=$ ?
As

$$
f_{1}-f_{2}= \pm n
$$

Then

$$
f_{3}=f_{1} \pm n
$$

Putting the values, we have

$$
f_{3}=256 \mathrm{~Hz} \pm 3 \mathrm{~Hz}
$$

Either

$$
f_{3}=256 \mathrm{~Hz}+3 \mathrm{~Hz}
$$

or

$$
f_{2}=256 \mathrm{~Hz}-3 \mathrm{~Hz}
$$

$$
f_{3}=259 \mathrm{~Hz} \quad \text { or } \quad 253 \mathrm{~Hz}
$$

In 1711. F. J. Shore, who was a royal trumpeter and lutenist invented tuning forks.

Let us consider 259 Hz as correct answer (i.e. frequency of second tuning fork). When first fork is loaded with wax, the frequency of first fork must fall below 256 Hz i.e., 255 Hz , 254 Hz and thus the number of beats produced per second will increase and will be greater than 3 beats. Since the number of beats per second decreases on loading first fork is one, therefore 259 Hz is not correct frequency of second tuning fork.
Thus, Correct frequency $=f_{2}=253 \mathrm{~Hz}$

### 7.10 INTENSITY (I) OF A WAVE

Intensity is defined as the amount of energy transmitted per unit area per unit time in the direction of propagation of progressive wave.
It is a measure of the power of a wave and is usually denoted by the symbol " $I$ ". It is measured in units of watts per square metre $\left(\mathrm{Wm}^{2}\right)$.
A progressive wave or travelling wave is one that travels through a medium in a consistent direction and transferring energy from one point to another. It is a wave that propagates or moves forward, as opposed to a stationary or standing wave. Examples of progressive waves include water waves, sound waves, light waves, etc.
By definition, the intensity of a wave is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& I=\frac{E}{A \times t} \\
& I-\frac{E_{t}}{A}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
I=\begin{array}{ll}
P \\
A
\end{array}\left(\because F_{f}=P\right)
$$

Here

$$
\begin{aligned}
& I=\text { Intensity of wave in }\left(\mathrm{W} \mathrm{m}^{2}\right) \\
& E=\text { Energy in joules (J) } \\
& t=\text { Time in seconds (s) } \\
& P=\text { Power in watts ( } \mathrm{W})
\end{aligned}
$$

We know that in mechanical waves, such as sound waves, water waves, or waves on a vibrating string, energy is stored as kinetic energy and potential energy of the medium's particles. How much energy is stored depends upon the displacement (amplitude) of the particles from the mean position. Therefore, the intensity I of waves is proportional to the square of the amplitude A, i.e.,

$$
\begin{array}{ll} 
& I \propto A^{2} \\
\text { or } & I=k A^{2} \ldots \ldots(7.14)
\end{array}
$$

Here $k$ is the constant of proportionality and depends upon the physical properties of the wave and the medium.

# Example 7.8 

(a) A wave has an intensity of $0.5 \mathrm{~W} \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ at a distance of 3.0 m from the source. What is the power of the wave?
(b) Two progressive waves have intensities of $0.5 \mathrm{~W} \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ and $0.25 \mathrm{~W} \mathrm{~m}^{2}$. Find total intensities of two waves.
Solution
(a)

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 1=0.5 \mathrm{~W} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \\
& r=3.0 \mathrm{~m} \\
& P=? \\
& \because I=\frac{P}{A} \\
& \because I=\frac{P}{4 \pi r^{2}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Putting the values, $0.5 \mathrm{~W} \mathrm{~m}^{2}=\frac{P}{4 \times 3.14(3.0 \mathrm{~m})^{2}}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& P=0.51 \times 13.04 \\
& P=56.52 \mathrm{~W} \\
& I_{1}=0.5 \mathrm{~W} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \\
& I_{2}=0.25 \mathrm{~W} \mathrm{~m}^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

## 1. Tildists

Frequency and amplitude of a travelling wave are independent of each other. That is why you can turn up the volume of a song (increase amplitude) without changing its pitch (which depends on frequency).

If the sound waves are spreading out evenly in all directions and the intensity of the sound waves is measured at a distance of 5 m from the speaker, what is the intensity of the sound waves if the area of the sphere (the surface area of a sphere) at that distance is approximately $314 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ ?

| Solution | Power $P=50 \mathrm{~W}$ |  |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
|  | Area $A=314 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ |  |
|  | Intensity $=$ | Power <br> Area |
|  | $I=\frac{P}{A}$ |  |

|  | $f \approx 0.159 \mathrm{~W} \mathrm{~m}^{-2}$ |  |

# 7.11 DOPPLER EFFECT 

The apparent change in the frequency (or pitch) of waves due to the relative motion between the source and observer (listener) is called Doppler Effect.
This effect was first observed by John Doppler while he was observing the frequency of light emitted from a star. In some cases, the frequency of emitted light was found to be slightly different from that emitted from a similar source on the Earth. He found that the change of frequency of light depends upon motion of star relative to Earth.
This effect can be observed with sound waves also. For example, when an observer is standing on a railway platform, the pitch of whistle of an engine coming towards the platform appears to become higher to an observer standing on the platform. However, the pitch of whistle of an engine going away from the platform appears to become lower to an observer standing on the platform.
Consider a source of sound $S$ at rest which emits sound waves having wavelength $\lambda$. Let speed of the sound for a stationary observer (i.e., listener) is $v$ then the number of waves received by observer in one second i.e., frequency $f$ is:

$$
f=\frac{v}{\lambda}
$$

# Case 1: When source of sound moves towards the stationary observer 

When the source moves towards the stationary observer $A$ with velocity $u_{x}$ then waves are compressed and their wavelength is decreased as shown in Fig. 7.14. In this case, the waves are compressed by an amount given as

$$
A \lambda=\frac{u_{x}}{f}
$$

The compression of the waves is due to the fact that same number of waves are contained in a shorter space depending upon the velocity of the source. The wavelength observed by the observer A is then,
or

$$
\lambda_{A}=\lambda-\Delta \lambda
$$

$$
\lambda_{A}=\frac{v}{f}-\frac{u_{x}}{f}
$$

$$
\lambda_{A}=\frac{v-u_{x}}{f}
$$

Here $\Delta \lambda$ is the decrease in wavelength in one second and is called Doppler shift.
[Image removed]

A source moving with velocity $u_{x}$ towards a stationary observer $A$ and away from stationary observer B respectively. Observer A hears an increased and observer B hears a decreased frequency.

Thus, the number of waves received by observer $A$ in one second (i.e., changed or apparent frequency) is

$$
f_{A}=\frac{v}{\lambda_{A}}
$$

Putting the value of $\lambda_{A}$, we have

$$
f_{A}=\left[\frac{v}{\left(v-u_{x}\right)_{f}}\right]
$$

As

$$
f_{A}=\left[\frac{v}{v-u_{x}}\right] f
$$

$$
\frac{v}{v-u_{x}}>1
$$

Therefore

$$
f_{A}>f
$$

Thus, the apparent frequency of sound heard by the observer increases which in turn will increase the pitch of sound.

## Case 2: When source of sound moves away from the stationary observer

When the source moves away from the stationary observer B with velocity $u_{x}$, then waves are expanded and their wavelength is increased. In this case, the waves

# Phycles II 

expanded by an amount:

$$
\lambda_{3}=\frac{u_{2}}{f}
$$

The expansion of the waves is due to the fact that same number of waves are now contained in a large distance. The wavelength observed by the observed $B$ is then,

$$
\lambda_{B}=\lambda+\Delta \lambda
$$

where $\Delta \lambda$ is the increase in wavelength in one second and is called Doppler shift.
Thus, the number of waves received by observer B in one second (i.e. changed or apparent frequency) is:

$$
f_{B}=\frac{v}{\lambda_{B}}
$$

Putting the value of $\lambda_{3}$, we have

As

Therefore

$$
f_{N}=\left[\frac{v}{\left(v+u_{2}\right)_{f}}\right]
$$

$$
f_{B}=\left[\frac{v}{\left(v+u_{2}\right)}\right] f
$$

$$
\frac{v}{v+u_{2}}<1
$$

Thus, the apparent frequency of sound heard by the observer decreases which in turn will decrease the pitch of sound.

As a plane accelerates, it builds up a front of air pressure by pushing air in front of it. When it passes the speed of sound, the pressure trails behind like a boat's wake, forming a sonic shockwave.

The loading truck $P$ travels at a steady speed of $12 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$, the other truck $Q$, travelling at a steady speed of $20 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$, sound its horn to emit a steady note which P's driver estimate, has a frequency of 830 Hz . What frequency does Q's own driver hear?

& u_{a}=20 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1} \\
& v=340 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1} \\
& f_{p}=830 \mathrm{~Hz} \\

Speed of $Q$ relative to $P=u_{s}=u_{Q}-u_{p}=20 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}-12 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}=8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \therefore \quad f=\left(\frac{v}{v-u_{s}}\right) f^{\prime} \\
& \therefore \quad f_{p}=\left(\frac{v}{v-u_{s}}\right) f_{Q}
\end{aligned}
$$

Putting the value, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 830 \mathrm{~Hz}=\left(\frac{340 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}}{340 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}-8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}\right) f_{Q} \\
& 830 \mathrm{~Hz}=\left(\frac{340 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}}{332 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}\right) f_{Q} \\
& \text { or } \quad f_{Q}=\left(\frac{830 \mathrm{~Hz} \times 332 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}{340 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}\right) \\
& \quad f_{Q}=810: 47 \mathrm{~Hz}

# 7.12 APPLICATIONS OF DOPPLER EFFECT 

Doppler effect is also applicable to electromagnetic waves. One of its important applications is the radar system, which uses radio waves to determine the elevation and speed of an aeroplane. RADAR (RAdio Detection And Ranging) is a device, which transmits and receives radio waves. If an aeroplane approaches towards the radar, then the wavelength of the wave reflected from aeroplane (a) would be shorter and if it moves away, then the wavelength would be larger as shown in Fig.7.15 (a) \& Fig.7.15 (b), respectively. Similarly, speed of satellites moving around the Earth can also be (b) determined by the same principle.
[Image removed]

Fig. 7.15:
A frequency shift is used in a radar to detod the motion of an aeroplane.

SONAR is an acronym derived from "Sound Navigation And Ranging". It is the general name for sonic or ultrasonic underwater echo-ranging and echo-scunding system. Sonar is the name of a technique for detecting the presence of objects under water by acoustical echo. In Sonar, "Doppler detection" relies upon the relative speed of the target and the detector to provide an indication of the target speed. It employs the Doppler effect, in which an apparent change in frequency occurs when the source and the observer are in relative motion to one another. Its known military applications include the detection and location of submarines, control of antisubmarine weapons, mine hunting and depth measurement of sea.
In Astronomy, astronomers use the Doppler effect to calculate the speeds of distant stars and galaxies. By comparing the line spectrum of light from the star with light from a laboratory source, the Doppler shift of the star's light can be measured. Then, the speed of the star can be calculated.
(i) Stars moving away from the Earth show a red shift as shown in Fig.7.16(b). The emitted waves have a longer wavelength than if the star had been at rest. So, the spectrum is shifted towards longer wavelength, i.e., towards the red end of the spectrum. Astronomers have also discovered that all the distant galaxies are moving away from us and by measuring their red shifts, they have estimated their speeds.
(ii) Stars moving towards the Earth show a blue shift as shown in Fig.7.16(c). This is because the wavelength of light emitted by the star are shorter than if the star had been at rest. So, the spectrum is shifted towards shorter wavelength, I.e., to the blue end of the spectrum.
Another important application of the Doppler shift using electromagnetic waves is the radar speed trap. Microwaves are emitted from a transmitter in short bursts. Each burst is reflected off by any car in the path of microwaves in between sending out bursts. The transmitter is open to detect reflected microwaves. If the reflection is caused by a moving obstacle, the reflected microwaves are Doppler shifted. By measuring the Doppler shift, the speed at which the car moves is

Satellite Navigation uses Doppler shift to determine satellite velocity and position, enabling accurate location tracking.
Satellite Communication also uses Doppler shift compensation ensuring stable communication signals.
Doppler radar detects wind velocity and precipitation patterns. Doppler shift helps measure Earth's surface velocity and deformation.
Doppler echocardiography measures blood flow velocity and detects cardiac abnormalities, such as valve stenosis or regurgitation. Doppler echocardiography optimizes pacemaker settings.
Doppler ultrasound measures blood flow and calculates cardiac output. Doppler ultrasound detects vascular stenosis or occlusion.

Example 7.12 The wavelength of one of its lines of the absorption spectrum of a faint galaxy is identified as $\mathrm{Ca}-\alpha$ line found to be 478 nm . The wavelength of same line is observed and measured as 397 nm in the laboratory.
(a) Is the galaxy moving towards or away from the Earth?
(b) Compute the speed of the galaxy relative to the Earth.

# Solution 

Laboratory measured original wavelength

$$
\lambda=397 \mathrm{~nm}=397 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~m}
$$

Changed or Apparent wavelength $\quad \lambda^{\prime}=478 \mathrm{~nm}=478 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~m}$
Speed of light

$$
c=3 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\because & v=f \lambda \\
\therefore & c=f \lambda \quad(\because v=c) \\
\Rightarrow & f=\frac{c}{\lambda} \\
& f=\frac{3 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}{397 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~m}} \\
& f=7.56 \times 10^{-3} \times 10^{6} \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

Laboratoy frequency $f=7.56 \times 10^{14} \mathrm{~Hz}$
Apparent frequency $f^{\prime}=\frac{c}{\lambda^{\prime}}$

$$
=\frac{3 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}{478 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~m}}
$$

$$
f^{\prime}=6.28 \times 10^{14} \mathrm{~Hz}
$$

# $\because \quad \lambda^{\prime}>\lambda$ or $\quad f^{\prime}<f$ 

$\therefore$ The galaxy is moving away from the Earth.
(b)

$$
\begin{aligned}
& f^{\prime}=\left(\frac{v}{v+u_{s}}\right) f \\
& f^{\prime}=\left(\frac{c}{c+u_{s}}\right) f \quad(\because v=c)
\end{aligned}
$$

Putting the values, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 6.28 \times 10^{14} \mathrm{~Hz}=\left(\frac{3 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}{3 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}+u_{s}}\right) 7.56 \times 10^{14} \mathrm{~Hz} \text { Galactic Motion } \\
& 3 \times 10^{6}+u_{s}=\frac{3 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1} \times 7.58 \times 10^{14} \mathrm{~Hz}}{6.28 \times 10^{14} \mathrm{~Hz}} \\
& u_{s}=\frac{22.68 \times 10^{6}}{6.28}-3 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\
& u_{s}=6.12 \times 10^{7} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

A galaxy is moving away from us at $20 \%$ of the speed of light (i.e., 0.2 c ). We observe a spectral line from this galaxy that is normally emitted at a wavelength of 600 nm .

## 8 Physical Optics and Gravitational Waves

## Learning Objectives

After studying this chapter, the students will be able to:

- Explain that polarization is a phenomenon associated with transverse waves.
- Define and apply Matus's law $1=I_{0}$ cos' $b$ to calculate the intensity of a plane-polarized electromagnetic wave after transmission through a polarizing filter or a series of polarizing filters. [Calculation of the effect of a polarizing filter on the intensity of an unpolarized wave is not required].
- Explain the use of polaroids in sky photography and stress analysis of materials.
- Describe qualitatively gravitational waves
(as waves of the intensity of gravity generated by the accelerated masses of an orbital binary system that propagate as waves outward from their source at the speed of light).
- State that as a gravitational wave passes a body with mass distortion in space-time can cause the body to stretch and compress periodically.
- State that gravitational waves pass through the Earth due to far off celestial events, but they are of very minute amplitude.
- Describe the use of interferometers in detecting gravitational waves.
[Interferometers are very sensitive detection devices that make use of the interference of laser beams (working and set up details are not required) and were used to first detect the existence of gravitational waves].

This chapter deals with two major areas of physics namely polarization of transverse waves and gravitational waves.

### 8.1 POLARIZATION OF LIGHT

Physical optics with reference to polarization deals with the behaviour of light waves and their interaction with matter.
Interference and diffraction effects prove the wave nature of light. These phenomena, however, do not tell us whether the light waves are longitudinal or transverse. Polarization of light suggests that the light waves are transverse in character.

In transverse mechanical waves, such as produced in a stretched string, the vibrations of the particles of the medium are perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the waves. The vibrations can be confined along vertical, horizontal or any other direction (Fig. 8.1). In each of these cases, the transverse mechanical wave is said to be
[Image removed]

Fig. 8.1: Transverse waves on a string polarized (a) in a vertical plane, and (b) in a horizontal plane

polarized. The plane of polarization is the plane containing the direction of vibration of the particles of the medium and the direction of propagation of the wave.
A light wave produced by oscillating charge consists of a periodic variation of the electric field vector $E$ accompanied by the magnetic field vector $B$ at right angles to it. Ordinary light has components of vibration in all possible planes. Such a light is unpolarized. On the other hand, if the vibrations are confined only in one plane, the light is said to be polarized. Unpolarized light is shownin Fig. 8.2.
Examples of unpolarized light sources are sunlight, incandescent light bulbs, fluorescent light bulbs, light from a candle or fire.
[Image removed]

Fig. 8.2: An unpolarized light, due to incandescent bulb, has vibrations in all planes.

Polarization is the process by which the electric and magnetic vibrations of light waves are restricted to a single plane of vibration. It is the property exhibited only by transverse waves such as light waves. It does not occur for longitudinal waves such as sound waves.

# How an Unpolarized Light be Polarized? 

An unpolarized light can be made polarized by the following methods:

1. Passing light through a polarizing filter (e.g, polaroid sheet).
2. Using a polarizing beam splitter.
3. Employing certain optical crystals or materials (e.g., calcite, quartz, etc.).

The most common method by which an unpolarized light can be polarized is by passing it through a polarizing filter, such as a polarizing beam splitter or a polaroid sheet. When an unpolarized light passes through the polarized filter, only that electric field vector which is parallel to the axis of polarized filter can pass through it, while all other vectors are blocked. The resultant light then becomes polarized as shown in Fig. 8.3.
Thus, in simple words, the process of transforming an unpolarized light into a polarized light is said to be polarization.
[Image removed]

Fig. 8.3: Polarization of light using a polarized filter

The orientation of the electric field vector $E$ of light waves in a specific direction is the basis of Polarization.

# 8.2 TYPES OF POLARIZATION 

Here are the basic types of polarization of light.

## 1. Linear Polarization

When the electric field vector oscillates in a single plane, light is said to be linearly polarized as shown in Fig.8.4 (a). Example is the light passing through a polarizing filter, like sunglasses.

## 2. Circular Polarization

When the electric field rotates circularly, either clockwise (right-handed), or counterclockwise (left-handed), the light is said to be circularly polarized as shown in Fig.8.4 (b). Example is the light reflected off a CD (Compact Disc) or DVD (Digital Versatile Disc).

## 3. Elliptical Polarization

A combination of linear and circular polarization, where the electric field vector traces an elliptical path is called elliptical polarization. In elliptical polarization as shown in Fig.8.4(c), the two components of electric field $E_{x}$ and $E_{y}$ are not equal or they differ in phase by an arbitrary angle $\theta$. Example is the light passing through a stress plate or a waveplate.

### 8.3 PRODUCTION AND DETECTION OF PLANE POLARIZED LIGHT

The light emitted by an ordinary incandescent bulb is unpolarized, because its electrical vibrations are randomly oriented in space as shown in Fig.8.2.
If unpolarized light is made incident on a sheet of polaroid (polarizer), the transmitted light will be plane polarized. If a second sheet of polaroid (analyzer) is placed in such a way that the axes of the two polaroids shown by stralght lines drawn on them are parallel (Fig. 8.5-a), the light is transmitted through the second polaroid. If the second polaroid (analyzer) is slowly rotated about the beam of light as axis of rotation, the light emerging from the second polaroid gets dimmer and dimmer and ultimately disappears when the axes become mutually perpendicular as shown in Fig. 8.5(b), the light reappears on

further rotation and becomes brightest when the axes are again parallel to each other.
This experiment proves that light waves are transverse waves. If the light waves were longitudinal, they would never disappear even if the two polaroids were mutually perpendicular.
[Image removed]

Light reflected from smooth surface of water is partially polarized parallel to the surface.

# 8.4 POLARIZATION OF LIGHT BY THE METHOD OF REFLECTION 

In 1808, Malus discovered that polarized light is obtained when ordinary light is reflected by a plane sheet of glass. If the reflected light is viewed through a polaroid which is slowly rotated about the line of vision, the light is practically extinguished at a certain
[Image removed]

Fig. 8.6: Plane polarization by reflection

orientation of the polaroid. The most suitable angle of incidence ' $i$ ' is about $57^{\circ}$ for glass for which the reflected ray becomes plane polarized, as illustrated by ray diagram in Fig. (8.6). This proves that the light reflected by the glass is practically plane polarized. Light reflected from the surface of a table becomes darker when viewed through a rotated polaroid, showing that it is partially plane polarized.

# Brewster's Law 

The particular angle of incidence on a transparent medium when the reflected light is almost plane polarized is called the polarizing angle. Let a beam of unpolarized light be made incident on the surface of medium 2 as shown in Fig.8.6. If the reflected beam of light is almost plane polarized, the reflected and refracted beams are at right angles to each other at the polarizing angle, $i=\theta_{p}$. Thus

$$
\theta_{p}+\theta_{r}=90^{\circ}
$$

or

$$
\theta_{r}=90^{\circ}-\theta_{p}
$$

From Snell's law,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& n_{1} \sin \theta_{p}=n_{2} \sin \theta_{r} \\
& n_{1} \sin \theta_{p}=n_{1} \sin \left(90^{\circ}-\theta_{p}\right) \\
& n_{1} \sin \theta_{p}=n_{2} \cos \theta_{p} \\
& \frac{\sin \theta_{p}}{\cos \theta_{p}}=\frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}} \\
& \tan \theta_{p}=\frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Molus's law is used to study the polarization of light in biological systems, such as the polarization of light by cell membranes.

This equation is known as Brewster's law. In this equation, $n_{1}$ is refractive index of medium 1 and $n_{2}$ is refractive index of medium 2. If medium 1 is air, then equation becomes $\tan \theta_{p}=n$ because $n_{1}=1$ and $n_{2}=n$. Here $n$ is refractive index of medium on which light is incident. Hence, Brewester proved that the tangent of the angle of polarization is numerically equal to the refractive index of the medium 2 when medium 1 is air. In Brewster's law, the angle ' $\theta_{p}$ ' for which the reflected ray and the refracted ray make an angle of $90^{\circ}$ between them, is also called the Brewster angle $\theta_{B}$. Then, $\tan \theta_{p}=n$ holds.

Example 8.1 A beam of light strikes the surface of a plate of glass with a refractive index of $\sqrt{3}$ at the polarizing angle. What will be the angle of refraction of the wave of light?

Solution

As

$$
\begin{aligned}
n & =\sqrt{3}, \theta_{r}=? \\
\tan \theta_{B} & =n \\
\theta_{B} & =\tan ^{-1}(\sqrt{3}) \\
\theta_{B} & =60^{\circ} \\
\theta_{r} & =90^{\circ}-\theta_{B}, \quad \theta_{r}=90^{\circ}-60^{\circ} \\
\theta_{r} & =30^{\circ}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\theta_{p}=90^{\circ}-\theta_{B}
$$

# 8.5 MALUS'S LAW 

Malus's law states that the intensity $I$ of plane polarized light after passing through an analyzer is directly proportional to the square of the cosine of the angle $\theta$ between the transmission axis of the analyzer and polarizer. That is;

$$
\begin{aligned}
& I \propto \cos ^{2} 0 \\
& I=I_{0} \cos ^{2} \theta
\end{aligned}
$$

where $I_{0}=$ Intensity of the incident polarized light.
Actually, Malus's law gives a mathematical relation between the intensity of the light incident on the first polaroid (i.e., polarizer) and the intensity of light obtained after passing it
[Image removed]

Fig 8.7 (a): Schematic representation of Malus's law
through the second polaroid (i.e., analyzer). This is shown in Fig. 8.7(a). An analyzer is also a polarizer that is placed after a polarizer. Rotation of the analyzer affects the intensity of the polarized light. It is used to further reduce the intensity of light and also adjustit by adjusting the angle of the analyzer with respect to the polarizer.
Certain transparent crystalline materials, like tourmaline, calcite crystals, etc., are capable of confining vibrations of light waves in only one plane. Such materials are called polaroids which have high directionality in crystal structure. Light can also be polarized by natural phenomena like reflection, refraction and scattering.
If a piece of polaroid is rotated in front of a polarized ray of light, it causes a variation in the intensity of the light that gets through. The reason that causes the variation of intensity is the angle between the initial polarizer and the axis of second polarizer.
When the incident polarized light of amplitude $A_{0}$ strikes the analyzer at an angle $\theta$, it is resolved into two components $A_{0} \cos \theta$ and $A_{0} \sin \theta$ as shown in Fig. 8.7(b). The component $A_{0} \sin \theta$ is absorbed in the analyzer. Since, only $A_{0} \cos \theta$ passes through the analyzer, the amplitude $A$ of the transmitted light is therefore,
[Image removed]

Fig.8.7(b): Resolution of amplitude into components of plane polarization light.

$$
A=A_{0} \cos \theta
$$

Since intensity $I$ is proportional to the square of the amplitude $A$. it can be expressed as:

# Physica II 

$I \propto A^{2}$ or $I=k A^{2}$
where $k=1$, we can write; $I=A^{2}$
or $\quad I=A_{0}^{2} \cos ^{2} \theta$

$$
I=I_{0} \cos ^{2} \theta\left(\because I_{0}=A_{0}^{2}\right)
$$

Here $I_{0}$ is the intensity of the incident polarized light.
There are two extreme conditions of $\theta$ followed by the above equation given as,
i. If $\theta=0^{\circ}$, then $I=I_{0}$. This means the Intensity transmitted through the analyzer is equal to the initial light intensity that passes through the polarizer.
[Image removed]
i. If $\theta=90^{\circ}$, then $I=0$. This means the light is extinguished completely, i.e., no light is allowed to pass through the analyzer.

## Optical Activity

Optical activity is the ability of a substance to rotate the plane of polarization of light passing through it. The rotation is detected with a polarizer or analyzer as shown in Fig. 8.6.
Many crystals and solutions rotate the plane of polarization of light passing through them. Such substances are said to be optically active. Examples are quartz crystals, cinnabar $\left(H_{2} S\right)$, sugar water, insulin and collagen. The amount and direction of rotation depends on following factors:
[Image removed]
(i) The type of substance
(ii) The concentration of the substance (the amount of a substance present in a given quantity of a mixture or solution).
(iii) The distance the light travels through it, and
(iv) The wavelength of light.

Optical activity occurs due to the asymmetric shape of molecules in the substance, such as being helical. A few millimetre thickness of such crystals will rotate the plane
[Image removed]

Sugar solution rotates the plane of polarization of incident light so that it is no longer horizontal but at an angle $\theta$. The analyzer thus stoos the light when rotated from the vertical (crossed) positions.

# Physica II 

of polarization by many degrees. Certain organic substances, such as sugar and tartaric acid, show optical rotation when they are in a solution. This property of optically active substances can be used to determine their concentration in the solutions.
Example 8.2 Find the refractive index of a medium if polarizing angle is $54.5^{\circ}$.

## Solution

$$
\theta_{n}=54.5^{\circ}, n=?
$$

As

$$
\tan \theta_{n}=n
$$

or

$$
n=\tan \theta_{n}
$$

So

$$
n=\tan 54.5^{\circ}
$$

$$
n=1.4
$$

Example 8.3 Polarized light with an intensity of 75 W $\mathrm{m}^{2}$ passes through an analyzer with its axis at $30^{\circ}$ to the polarizer's axis. What is the emerging intensity?

## Solution

$$
I_{0}=75 \mathrm{~W} \mathrm{~m}^{2}, \theta=30^{\circ}, I=?
$$

Using Malus's law:

$$
\begin{aligned}
I & =\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{n}} \cos ^{2} \theta \\
I & =75 \mathrm{Nm}^{2} \cos ^{2} 30^{\circ} \\
& =75 \mathrm{Nm}^{2}(6.866)^{2} \\
& =75 \mathrm{Nm}^{2} \times 0.75 \\
I & =56.25 \mathrm{~W} \mathrm{~m}^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

[Image removed]

Looking through two polarizers when they are "crossed", very little light passes through.

Example 8.4 A polarized light with an amplitude of 5 units passes through a polarizer with its electric field aligned at $60^{\circ}$ to the original polarization direction. Find the amplitude of the wave after passing through the analizer?

Solution

$$
A_{0}=5 \text { units, } \theta=60^{\circ}, A=?
$$

Using Malus's law:

$$
\begin{aligned}
A & =A_{n} \cos \theta \\
A & =5 \cos 60^{\circ} \\
& =5 \times 0.5 \\
A & =2.5 \text { units }
\end{aligned}
$$

## Indist

A beam of unpolarized light passes through a foggy atmosphere. Tell the polarization state of the scattered light.

## Importance of Polarization

The immense significance of polarization of light may be justified by various fields:

# 1. Optics and Photonics 

Polarization is essential for applications like polarized sunglasses, LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) screens, and optical communication systems.

## 2. Imaging and Microscopy

Polarization enhances image quality, reducing glare (unwanted light that interferes with vision) and improving contrast, especially in microscopy and medical imaging.

## 3. Medical Applications

Polarization is used in cancer diagnosis, tissue imaging, and laser surgery, leveraging its ability to distinguish between different tissue types.

## 4. Astronomy

Polarization helps us to analyze cosmic phenomena, like the polarization of light from distant stars or the cosmic microwave background radiation.

## 5. Miscellaneous Fields

Polarization has importance in miscellaneous fields such as optics and photonics, imaging and microscopy, biology and chemistry, communication system, etc.

## Two Main Applications of Polarization

Polarizers, also known as polarizing filters, have two main applications:

## 1. Sky Photography

A camera which is used to photograph the clouds is fitted with a polaroid. The light coming from the sky is polarized by the polaroid.
In sky photography, polarizers are used to reduce the glare and haze which are produced by the scattering of light by small particles of molecules present in the atmosphere. Polarizers also enhance the contrast by clocking the excessive bright white light while allowing the other colours to pass through, thus creating a brighter detailed image. Thus, allows to improve the overall image quality.

## 2. Stress Analysis of Materials

In materials science, polarizers are used to analyze the stress and strain on materials, such as plastics, metals, and glass.
When a material is stressed, its molecular structure changes, affecting the way, it

interacts with light, and interference patterns on fringes are formed which in turn gives qualitative information about the material. By shining polarized light through the transparent material and analyzing the changes in the light's polarization, the researchers can:

- determine the material's stress patterns
- identify potential weaknesses or defects
- analyze the material's optical properties
- understand how the material will behave under different conditions. This technique is known as "photoelasticity" and is widely used in fields like engineering, materials science, and quality control.
In both cases described above, polarizers play a crucial role in manipulating light to achieve specific goals, whether it is enhancing image quality or analyzing material properties.


# 8.6 GRAVITATIONAL WAVES (GWs) 

A gravitational wave is a stretching and compressing of space-time and can be observed by measuring the change in length between two objects.
Gravitational waves (GWs) are actually:
"Ripples in the fabric of space-time, produced by violent cosmic events, like colliding black holes or neutron stars that travel at the speed of light, carrying information about their source."
The simplest example to understand GWs is given below:
[Image removed]

Albert Einstein (1878-1955)
A German born Theoretical Physicist
One of the World's renowned scientists.

If we throw a stone into a pond, the stone creates ripples on the water surface (space-time). These ripples travel outward, carrying information about the stone (the cosmic event). They can be detected on the shore by (gravitational wave observatories), revealing the stone's presence and properties.

## Prediction and Detection

Gravitational waves are a prediction of Einstein's theory of general relativity which is confirmed by observations and is opening a new window into the universe's most extreme phenomena.
According to Einstein's general theory of relativity, gravity is not a force, but a curvature of space-time caused by massive bodies. Gravity is like a dent in a mattress. Heavy things wrap the space around them, and that is why we feel gravity.
Gravitational waves, as initially predicted by Albert Einstein in 1916, are ripples in spacetime that were first detected in 2015, but announced in 2016, the first

# Physics II 

observation of its kind: the detection of gravitational waves, produced from two colliding neutron stars. In this type, there is a gradual increase in frequency and amplitude of GWs.
A Binary System (BS) in the context of gravitational waves refers to "a system consisting of two compact objects, such as black holes, neutron stars, or white dwarfs, which are orbiting each other and emitting gravitational waves."

## Four Basic Types of GWs

There are four basic types of gravitational waves, each with different sources and characteristics:

## 1. Continuous GWs

[Image removed]

Dr. Nergis Mavalwala is a Pakistani-American Astrophysics at MIT known for her work on gravitational waves

When a single massive object spins with a constant rate, such as a neutron star, continuous GWs are produced with a constant frequency and amplitude. White dwarf binary systems produce continuous GWs.

## 2. Compact Binary Inspirational GWs

When a binary system, such as binary neutron stars, binary black holes, or a neutron star and black hole orbiting each other, compact inspirational GWs are produced.

## 3. Burst GWs

These are produced by violent events like supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, or cosmic strings.

## 4. Stochastic GWs

[Image removed]

BS Model

Stochastic GWs are weak, random signals of GWs which are produced by superposition of many weak gravitational wave sources, such as distant binary systems. These GWs are the most difficult to detect.
Every physical object that accelerates, produces gravitational waves. Vehicles, airplanes, etc. are included in it. The masses and acceleration of objects on the Earth are too small to make gravitational waves big enough to be detected with our instruments.

As the binary systems (also termed as binaries) orbit each other, they emit gravitational waves, which can be detected by observatories like LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory) which is situated in USA and Virgo, a large scale gravitational wave observatory in Cascina, Italy. The waves carry information about the system's mass, spin, and merger dynamics, offering insights into these extreme cosmic objects, and move with the speed of light.
[Image removed]

Picture of a series of concentric spheres, with the binary system at the center, radiating gravity waves outward into the cosmos.

The binary systems are significant sources of gravitational waves, and their mergers (collision and union of two massive objects resulting more massive single object) are among the most intense cosmic events.

As the masses orbit and accelerate, their gravitational intensity fluctuates, generating waves that radiate outward in all directions. These waves are not bound by the binary system's gravity; instead, they travel freely through spacetime at the speed of light. The waves propagate through the universe, weakening in intensity as they distance themselves from the source.

The characteristics of GWs depend on the system's properties, such as:
[Image removed]

Tidal forces carry the mathematical signature of gravitational waves.

- Masses of the objects
- Orbital period and frequency
- Eccentricity of the orbit: Eccentricity $e$ is a measure of the amount by which an object deviates from a perfect circle.

| $e=0$ | Circular orbit |
| :-- | :-- |
| $e=1$ | Parabolic trajectory |
| $e>1$ | Hyperbolic trajectory |
| $0<e<1$ | Elliptical orbit |

# Space-time Distortion/Tidal Forces 

Gravitational waves passing through a body with mass can cause the body to experience periodic stretching and compressing, also known as "space-time distortion". This effect is known as "tidal forces" and is a result of the gravitational wave's oscillating nature. As the gravitational wave passes through
[Image removed]

Spacetime curve of an artificial and a natural satellite
the body, it causes the space-time around the body to oscillate, leading to a periodic stretching and compressing of the body in the direction perpendicular to the wave's propagation. This effect is similar to how the tides on Earth are caused by the gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun.
The amount of stretching and compressing depends on the strength of the gravitational wave, as well as the mass and size of the body. This effect is an important prediction of Einstein's general theory of relativity.
Gravitational waves generated by far off celestial events, such as the merger of two black holes or neutron stars, pass through the Earth. However, the amplitude of these waves is extremely small, typically of the order of $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-2}$ metres. This means that the
[Image removed]

Spacetime curve shown by two satellites
distortion caused by the gravitational wave is incredibly tiny, and requires extremely sensitive instruments to detect.
Despite their small amplitude, gravitational waves offer a unique window into the universe, allowing us to study strong-field gravity, to test general relativity, and to explore the universe in ways previously impossible.

### 8.7 INTERFEROMETER

An interferometer is an optical tool used in detecting gravitational waves. It is a very sensitive detection device that may use the interference of LASER (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiatoin) beams. The basic LIGO interferometer can be seen in Fig. 8.9.
An interferometer that detects gravitational waves is a highly sensitive instrument that uses LASER light to measure tiny changes in distance between mirrors, caused by gravitational waves passing through the detectors. These interferometers are called

# Physics II 

LIGO (LASER Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory). The main differences between LIGO and conventional interferometers are:
(a) LIGO is 1000 times larger than conventional device, and
(b) LIGO uses LASER whereas conventional interferometer has normal light source.

## Basic Components of GW Interferometer

The basic components of a gravitational wave interferometer are:
[Image removed]

Fig. 8.9: Basic LIGO interferometer

1. Laser that produces a stable and high intensity beam of light.
2. Power recycling mirror continually reflects LASER light that has already travelled through the instrument back into the interferometer and hence the term recycling is used.
3. Beam splitter divides the LASER beam into two perpendicular beams.
4. Mirrors reflect the beams, creating two perpendicular arms.
5. Fabry Perot cavity consists of two mirrors facing each other. The purpose of the cavity is to enhance the path length.
6. Photodetectors measure the returning beams, detecting tiny phase shifts (if any).
7. Arm cavities enhance the LASER light, increasing sensitivity.

## Working of Interferometer

A laser beam is split into two perpendicular beams, each travelling down two identical paths (arms) of the interferometer. The beams bounce off mirrors at the ends of each arm and return to the starting point, where they are recombined. If a gravitational wave passes through, it causes a tiny disturbance in the distance between the mirrors, resulting in a phase shift between the two beams.
When the beams recombine, they create an interference pattern, which is measured by a photodetector. The tiny phase shift caused by the gravitational wave alters the interference pattern, allowing the detector to sense the wave's presence.
Figure 8.9 is a simple figure of an interferometer, but in reality, it is much more complex. On 14 September 2015, the universe's gravitational waves were observed for the very first time by LIGO. The gravitational waves which were predicted by Albert Einstein

100 years ago, came from a collision between two black holes. It took 1.3 billion years for the waves to arrive at the LIGO detector in the USA. On their work on observation of GWs, Rainer Weiss, Barry C. Barisk and Kip S. Throne received Nobel Prize in 2017. It is interesting to note that one of the team members, Nergis Mavalwala a professor at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), belongs to Pakistan.

# Virgo Detection 

Similar to LIGO, there is another facility for measuring gravitational waves. This is called Virgo, which works under the European Gravitational Observatory (EGO) Cascina near Pisa, Italy. Virgo is also an interferometer with two arms of 3 km whereas LIGO has 4 km arms. The Virgo Observatory is named after the Virgo constellation, which is visible in the night sky during the months of March, April and May. The Virgo cluster is a group of about 1,500 galaxies about 50 MLYs (Million Light Years) away. Remember one Light Year (LY) is a distance which light travels in one year. The approximate value of $1 \mathrm{LY}=9.5$ billion km . Virgo has been involved in detecting gravitational wave events, with the first detection in 2017.

Example 8.5 If the gravitational waves have a wavelength of 4000 km , find their frequency.

Solution $\lambda=4000 \mathrm{~km}=4 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~m}, c=3 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}, f=$ ?
As $\quad v=f \lambda$
or $\quad f=\frac{c}{\lambda} \quad(\because v=c)$
$\because \quad f=\frac{3 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}}{4 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~m}}$
$f=0.75 \times 10^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$
$f=75 \mathrm{~Hz}$
Example 8.6 A binary system emits gravitational
waves with a frequency of $10^{-1} \mathrm{~Hz}$. What is the
wavelength of these waves?
Solution $f=10^{-1} \mathrm{~Hz}=10^{-1} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}, \mathrm{c}=3 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}, \lambda=$ ?
As $\quad v=f \lambda$
or $\quad \lambda=\frac{c}{f} \quad(\because v=c)$
$\therefore \quad \lambda=\frac{3 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}{10^{-1} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}$
$\lambda=3 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~m}$

We know that magnitude of the charge on an electron is equal to that of a proton. The charge on a proton is $e^{\prime}$ and that on an electron is $e^{\prime \prime}$. Its value is; $e=1.6 \times 10^{-3}$ C where C (coulomb) is the SI unit of charge. This charge (e) is the smallest amount of free charge that has been discovered. Charges of larger magnitude are built up on an object by adding or removing electrons. It is the minimum amount of charge that any

# 11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.11.1

As stated earlier, Coulombs' force is mutual force, it means that if $q_{1}$ exerts a force on $q_{2}$, then $q_{2}$ also exerts an equal and opposite force on $q_{1}$ if we denote the force exerted on $q_{2}$ by $q_{1}$ as $F_{21}$ and that on charge $q_{1}$ due to $q_{2}$ as $F_{12}$ then

$$
F_{12}=-F_{21}
$$

The magnitude of both these two forces is the same and is given by Eq. 9.3. To represent the direction of these forces, we introduce unit vectors. If $\hat{r}_{21}$ is the unit vector directed from $q_{1}$ to $q_{2}$ and $\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{12}$ is the unit vector directed from $q_{2}$ to $q_{1}$ then

$$
\begin{aligned}
& F_{21}=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{r^{2}} \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{21} \\
& F_{12}=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{r^{2}} \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{12}
\end{aligned}
$$

The forces $F_{21}$ and $F_{12}$ are shown in Fig. 9.2 (a and b). It can be seen that $\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{21}=-\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{12}$, so Eqs. 9.5 and 9.6 show that;

$$
\mathbf{F}_{21}=-\mathbf{F}_{12}
$$

The sign of the charges in Eqs. 9.5 and 9.6 determine whether the forces are attractive or repulsive.
We shall now consider the effect of medium between the two charges upon the Coulomb's force. If the medium is an insulator, it is usually referred as dielectric. It has been found that the presence of a dielectric always reduces the electrostatic force as compared with that in free space by a certain factor which is a constant for the given dielectric. This constant is known as relative permittivity and is represented by $\varepsilon$. The values of relative permittivity of different dielectrics are given in Table 9.1.
Thus, the Coulomb's force in a medium of relative permittivity $\varepsilon_{r}$ is given by

$$
F_{r}=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0} \varepsilon_{r}} \frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{r^{2}}
$$

It can be seen in the table that $\varepsilon_{r}$, for air is 1.0006 . This value is so close to one that with negligible error, the Eq. 9.3 gives the electric force in air.

Example 9.3 Three point charges $q_{1}, q_{2}$ and $q_{3}$ are lying in the same plane as shown in Fig. 9.3(a). Find the magnitude and direction of the net fore acting on $q_{1}$.

## Solution

Force on $q_{1}$ exerted by $q_{2}$ is attractive. Let it be $F_{12}$. Its magnitude is given by
[Image removed]

Fig. 9.3(a)

$$
F_{12}=k \frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{r_{2}^{2}}=\frac{\left(9 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{C}^{2}\right)\left(40 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{C}\right)\left(60 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{C}\right)}{(0.15 \mathrm{~m})^{2}}=960 \mathrm{~N}
$$

Force on $q_{1}$ exerted by $q_{2}$ is also attractive. Let it be $F_{12}$. Its magnitude is given by

$$
F_{12}-k \frac{q_{1} q_{3}}{r_{3}^{2}}-\frac{\left(9 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{Nm}^{2} \mathrm{C}^{2}\right)\left(40 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{C}\right)\left(50 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{C}\right)}{\left(0.12 \mathrm{~m}^{2}\right)}-1250 \mathrm{~N}
$$

To find the resultant of $F_{12}$ and $F_{13}$, let us make free-body diagram, resolving $F_{13}$ into its rectangular components, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
& F_{13 x}=F_{13} \cos 60^{\circ}=1250 \mathrm{~N} \times 0.5=625 \mathrm{~N} \\
& F_{13 y}=F_{13} \sin 60^{\circ}=1250 \mathrm{~N} \times 0.86=1075 \mathrm{~N}
\end{aligned}
$$

The $x$-component of resultant $F$ is

$$
F_{x}=F_{12}+F_{13} \cos 60^{\circ}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& F_{x}=960 \mathrm{~N}+625 \mathrm{~N} \\
& F_{x}=1585 \mathrm{~N}
\end{aligned}
$$

$y$-component of $F$ is:

$$
F_{y}-F_{12} \sin 60^{\circ}-1075 \mathrm{~N}
$$

Magnitude of $F$ is given by

$$
F=\sqrt{F_{x}^{2}+F_{y}^{2}}=1975 \mathrm{~N}
$$

For direction of $F$ :

$$
\tan 9=\frac{F_{y}}{F_{x}}=\frac{1075}{1585}=0.68
$$

A Van de Graaff generator is an electrostatic generator which uses a moving belt to accumulate electric charge on a hollow metal globe on the top of an insulated column, creating very high voltage direct current (DC) at low current levels. It was invented by an American physicist Robert J. Van de Graff in 1920.
The potential difference achieved in modern Van de Graaff generators can reach 5 megavolts. A tabletop version can produce of the order of 100,000 volts and can produce enough energy to produce a visible spark.
A pulley drives an inauiting belt by a sharply pointed metal comb which has been given a positive charge by a power supply. Electrons are removed from the belt, leaving it positively charged. A similar comb at the top allows the net positive charge to spread to the dome.
Why do the hairs lift when VAN DE GRAAFF GENERATOR is touched?

Therefore, $B=34^{\circ}$ with the line joining $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$.

# 9.2 ELECTRIC FIELD STRENGTH 

We have learnt that a charge experiences an electrostatic force in the presence of other charges. Let us consider a positively charged object $Q$. If we place a small charge $+q$ at point $A$, it will experience an electrostatic force $F$ due to the charge $Q$. Thus, an electric field is said to exist at point $A$. Coulomb's law suggests that the field gets stronger as the point $A$ gets closer to $Q$ as represented in Fig. 9.4. The strength of the field at a position is known as its intensity at that point.
[Image removed]

Fig. 9.4

The electric intensity of the field or simply electric field at any point is defined as the force experienced by a unit positive charge placed at that point.
Electric intensity is a force, so it is a vector quantity and is usually denoted by $E$. It can be obtained by the relation:

# Physics II 

$$
E=\frac{F}{q}
$$

As

$$
\begin{aligned}
& F-\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q Q}{r^{2}} \quad \therefore \quad E-\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{Q}{r^{2}} \\
& \text { In vector form: } \\
& E=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{Q}{r^{2}} \hat{r}
\end{aligned}
$$

From Eq. 9.8, the unit of electric intensity is newton per coulomb $\mathrm{N} \mathrm{C}^{-1}$. The direction of $E$ is the same as that of $F$. The Eq. 9.5 can also be written as:

$$
F=q E
$$

(9.9)

Example 9.2 Two positive point charges $q_{1}=16.0 \mu \mathrm{C}$ and $q_{2}=4.0 \mu \mathrm{C}$ are separated by a distance of 3.0 m , as shown in Fig.9.5. Find the spot on the line joining the two charges where electric field is zero.
[Image removed]

Fig. 9.5

Solution Between the two charges, the fields contributed by them have opposite directions, and electric field would be zero at a point $P$, where the magnitude of $E_{1}$ equals to $E_{2}$. In Fig. 9.5, let the distance of $P$ from $q_{1}$ be $d$. At $P_{1} E_{2}=E_{2}$ which implies that:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q_{1}}{(3.0-d)^{2}}-\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \frac{q_{2}}{d^{2}} \\
& \text { or } \quad \frac{16.0 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{C}}{9.0+d^{2}-6 d}=\frac{4.0 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{C}}{d^{2}} \text { or } d^{2}+2 d-3=0 \text {, which gives } d=+1 \mathrm{~m},-3 \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}
$$

There are two values of $d$, the negative value corresponds to a location off to the right of both the charges where magnitudes of $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ are equal but directions are same. In this case $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ do not cancel at this spot. The positive value corresponds to the location shown in the figure and is the zero filed location, hence, $d=+1.0 \mathrm{~m}$.

Example 9.3 A proton experiences an electrostatic force equal to its weight at a particular point in an electric field. What is the field intensity at that point?
Mass of proton $=1.67 \times 10^{-27} \mathrm{~kg}$ and charge, $e=1.6 \times 10^{-15} \mathrm{C}$
Using

$$
E=\frac{F}{q}=\frac{m g}{e}
$$

Substituting the values,

$$
E=\frac{1.67 \times 10^{-27} \mathrm{~kg} \times 9.8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}}{1.6 \times 10^{-15} \mathrm{C}}=1.0 \times 10^{-7} \mathrm{NC}^{-1}
$$

## Electric Field Lines

A visual representation of the electric field can be obtained in terms of electric field lines, an idea proposed by Michael Faraday. Electric field lines can be considered as a visual map used to represent the direction and strength of an electric field around a charged object. As electric field lines provide information about the electric force exerted on a

charged object, these lines are commonly called "electric lines of force".
To introduce electric field lines, we place positive test charges $+q_{0}$ each of magnitude $q_{0}$ at different places but at equal distances from a positive charge $+q$ as shown in the Fig. 9.6. Each test charge will experience a repulsive force, as indicated by arrows in Fig. 9.6(a). Therefore, the electric field created by the charge $+q$ is directed radially outward. Figure 9.6(b) shows corresponding field lines which show the field
[Image removed]

direction. Figure 9.7 shows the electric field lines in the vicinity of a negative charge $-q$. In this case the lines are directed radially "inward", because the force on a positive test charge is now of attraction, indicating the electric field points inward.
Figures 9.6 and 9.7 represent two dimensional pictures of the field lines. However, electric field lines emerge from the charges in three dimensions, and an infinite number of lines could be drawn.
The electric field lines "map" also provides information about the strength of the electric field. As we notice in Figs. 9.6 and 9.7 that field lines are closer to each other near the charges where the field is strong while they continuously spread out indicating a continuous decrease in the field strength.

The number of lines per unit area passing perpendicularly through it is proportional to the magnitude of the electric field.
The electric field lines are curved in case of two identical separated charges. Figure 9.8 shows the pattern of lines associated with two identical positive point charges of

equal magnitude. It reveals that the lines in the region between two like charges seem to repel each other. The behaviour of two identical negatively charges will be exactly the same. The middle region shows the presence of a zero field spot or neutral zone.
Figure 9.9 shows the electric field pattern of two opposite charges of equal magnitudes. The field lines start from positive charge and end on a negative charge. The electric field at points such as $1,2,3$ is the resultant of fields created by the two charges at these points. The directions of the resultant intensities is given by the tangents drawn to the field lines at these points.
In the regions where the field lines are parallel and equally spaced, the same number of lines pass per unit area and therefore, field is uniform on all points. Figure 9.10 shows the field lines between the plates of a parallel plate capacitor. The field is uniform in the middle region where field lines are equally spaced.
We are now in a position to summarize the properties of electric field lines.

1. Electric field lines originate from positive charges and end on negative charges.
2. The tangent to a field line at any point gives the direction of the electric field at that point.
3. The lines are closer where the field is strong and the lines are farther apart where the field is weak.
4. No two lines cross each other. This is because E hes only one direction at any given point. If the lines cross E could have more than one direction.

### 9.3 ELECTRIC FLUX

When we place an element of area in an electric field, some of the lines of force pass through it (Fig. 9.11). The number of the field lines passing through a certain element of area is known as electric flux through that area. It is usually denoted by Greek letter $\phi_{0}$. For example, the electric flux $\phi_{0}$ through the area $A$ is 4 while the flux through B is 2 .
In order to give a quantitative meaning to flux, the field

[Image removed]

lines are drawn such that the number of field lines passing through a unit area held perpendicular to field lines at a point represent the intensity $E$ of the field at that point.
Usually, the element of area is represented by a vector area $A$ whose magnitude is equal to the surface area $A$ of the element and direction is along normal to the area.
In Fig.9.12 (a), area $A$ is held perpendicular to the field lines, then EA lines pass through it. The flux $\phi_{n}$ in this case is:

$$
\phi_{n}=E A
$$

In Figure 9.12 (b), area $A$ is held parallel to field lines and, as is obvious no lines cross this area, so that flux $\phi_{n}$ in this case is:

$$
\phi_{n}=E A=0
$$

Figure 9.12(c) shows the case when $A$ is neither perpendicular nor parallel to field lines but is inclined at an angle $\theta$ with the field $E$. In this case, we have to find the projection of the area which is perpendicular to the field lines. The area of this projection (Fig. 9.12-c) is $A \cos \theta$. The flux $\phi_{n}$ in this case is:

$$
\phi_{n}=E A \cos \theta
$$

The electric flux $\phi_{n}$ through a patch of flat surface in terms of $E$ and $A$ is then given by

$$
\phi_{n}=E A \cos \theta=E \cdot A
$$

where $\theta$ is the angle between the field lines and the normal to the area. Electric flux being a scalar product, is a scalar quantity. Its SI unit is $\mathrm{Nm}^{2} \mathrm{C}^{4}$.

# Electric Flux Through a Surface Enclosing a Charge 

Let us calculate the electric flux through a closed surface, in shape of a sphere of radius $r$ due to a point charge $q$ placed at the centre of sphere as shown in Fig. 9.13. To apply the formula $\phi_{n}=E . A$ for the computation of electric flux, the surface area should be flat. For this reason the total surface area of the

[Image removed]

Fig.9.12(b): Minimum
[Image removed]

Fig.9.13: The total electric flux through the surface of the sphere due to a charge $q$ at its centre is $q \delta_{0}$.

sphere is divided into $n$ small patches with areas of magnitudes $\Delta A_{1}, \Delta A_{2}, \Delta A_{3}, \ldots \ldots$ $\Delta A_{n}$, respectively as shown in Fig. 9.13. The direction of each vector area is along perpendicular drawn outward to the corresponding patch. The electric intensities at the centres of vector areas $\Delta A_{1}, \Delta A_{2}, \Delta A_{3}, \ldots \ldots, \Delta A_{n}$ are $E_{1}, E_{2}, E_{3}, \ldots \ldots, E_{n}$ respectively.
According to Eq. 9.13, the total flux passing through the closed surface is:

$$
Q_{n}=E_{1} \cdot \Delta A_{1}+E_{2} \cdot \Delta A_{2}+E_{3} \cdot \Delta A_{3}+\ldots \ldots \ldots+E_{n} \cdot \Delta A_{n}
$$

The direction of electric intensity and vector area is the same at each patch. Moreover,

$$
\left|E_{1}\right|=\left|E_{2}\right|=\left|E_{3}\right|=\ldots \ldots \ldots=\left|E_{n}=E=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{n}} \frac{q}{r^{2}}\right.
$$

Since $E$ is parallel to vector area $A_{1}$ therefore, $\theta=0^{\circ}$ (Fig. 9.13) so for each $E . \Delta A=E A \cos 0$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =E A \cos 0^{\circ}=E A \quad\left(\because \cos 0^{\circ}=1\right) \\
& \phi_{0}-E \Delta A_{1}+E \Delta A_{2}+E \Delta A_{3}+\ldots \ldots \ldots+E \Delta A_{n} \\
& -E\left(\Delta A_{1}+\Delta A_{2}+\Delta A_{3}-\ldots \ldots+\Delta A_{n}\right) \\
& -E \text { (Total spherical surface area) } \\
& =\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{n}} \frac{q}{r^{2}} \times 4 \pi r^{2} \\
& \phi_{0}=\frac{q}{\varepsilon_{n}} \\
& \text { (9.16) }
\end{aligned}
$$

Now Imagine that a closed surface $S$ is enclosing this sphere. It can be seen in Fig 9.14 that the flux through
[Image removed]

Fig: 9.14
the closed surface $S$ is the same as that through the sphere. So, we can conclude that total flux through a closed surface does not depend upon the shape or geometry of the closed surface. It depends upon the medium and the charge enclosed.

# 9.4 GAUSS'S LAW 

Suppose point charges $q_{1}, q_{2}, q_{3}, \ldots \ldots, q_{n}$ are arbitrarily distributed within an arbitrarily shaped closed surface, as shown in Fig. 9.15. Since $\phi_{n}=q / \varepsilon_{n}$, so the electric flux passing through the closed surface is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \phi_{0}=\frac{q_{1}}{\varepsilon_{0}} \cdot \frac{q_{2}}{\varepsilon_{0}} \cdot \frac{q_{3}}{\varepsilon_{0}} \cdot \ldots \ldots \cdot \frac{q_{n}}{\varepsilon_{0}} \\
& \phi_{n}=\frac{1}{\varepsilon_{0}} \times\left(q_{1}+q_{2}+q_{3}+\ldots \ldots \ldots+q_{n}\right) \\
& \phi_{n}=\frac{1}{\varepsilon_{n}} \times \text { (Total charge enclosed by closed surface) } \\
& \phi_{n}=\frac{1}{\varepsilon_{n}} \times Q
\end{aligned}
$$

[Image removed]

Fig: 9.15

where $Q=q_{1}+q_{2}+q_{3}+\ldots \ldots \ldots+q_{n}$ is the total charge enclosed by closed surface. Equation 9.17 is mathematical expression of Gauss's law which can be slated as:

The total electric flux through any closed surface is $1 / k_{0}$ times the total charge enclosed in it.

# Applications of Gauss's Law 

Gauss's law can be applied to calculate the electric intensity due to different charge configurations. In all such cases, an imaginary closed surface is considered which passes through the point at which the electric intensity is to be evaluated. This closed surface is known as Gaussian surface. Its choice is such that the flux through it can be easily evaluated.
As an example, let us find the electric field at any point outside a sphere on which a charge $q$ is placed.

## The Field of a Charged Conducting Sphere

Consider a conducting sphere of radius $R$ containing a charge $q$. We know that all the charge is distributed uniformly over the surface of sphere as shown in Fig. 9.16. We can also conclude from the spherical symmetry that the electric field is radial everywhere and that its magnitude depends only on the distance $r$ from the centre of the sphere. Thus, the magnitude $E$ is uniform over a spherical surface with any radius $r$ concentric with the spherical conductor. Therefore, we take our Gaussian surface as an imaginary sphere with radius $r$ greater than the radius $R$ of the conducting sphere.
The area of the Gaussian sphere is $4 \pi r^{2}$, and because $E$ is uniform over the sphere, the total flux through the whole surface will be:
Electric flux

$$
\phi_{2}=E A=E \times 4 \pi r^{2}
$$

By Gauss's law, total flux is:

Therefore

$$
E \times 4 \pi r^{2}=\frac{q}{E}
$$

or

$$
E=\frac{q}{E_{1}} \frac{1}{4 \pi r^{2}}
$$

or

$$
E=\frac{1}{4 \pi E_{1}} \times \frac{q}{r^{2}}
$$

This shows that the field at any point outside the sphere is the same as though the entire charge were concentrated at its centre. Just outside of the sphere, where $r=R$, i.e.,

$$

# 9.5 ELECTRIC POTENTIAL 

Figure 9.17 shows two oppositely charged parallel plated which produce a uniform electric field.
Let us consider a positive charge $q$ which is allowed to move in this uniform electric field. The positive charge will move from plate $B$ to $A$ and will gain $K . E$. If it is to be moved from $A$ to $B$, an external force is needed to make the charge move against the electric field and will gain P.E. Let us impose a condition that as the charge is moved from $A$ to $B$, it is moved keeping electrostatic equilibrium, i.e., it moves with uniform velocity. This

condition could be achieved by applying a force $F$ equal and opposite to $q E$ at every point along its path. The work done by the external force against the electric field increases electrical potential energy of the charge that is moved.
Let $W_{\text {Aa }}$ be the work done by the force in carrying the positive charge $q$ from $A$ to $B$ while keeping the charge in equilibrium. The change in its potential energy $\Delta U=W_{\text {Aa }}$.
or $\quad U_{0}-U_{A}=W_{A B}$
where $U_{A}$ and $U_{0}$, are defined to be the potential energies at points $A$ and $B$, respectively.
To describe electric field, we introduce the idea of electric potential difference. The potential difference between two points $A$ and $B$ in an electric field is defined as the work done in carrying a unit positive charge from $A$ to $B$ while keeping the charge in equilibrium, i.e.,

$$
\Delta V=V_{B}-V_{A}=\frac{W_{A B}}{q}=\frac{\Delta U}{q}
$$

where $V_{A}$ and $V_{B}$ are defined as electric potentials at points $A$ and $B$ respectively. Electric potential energy difference and electric potential difference between the points $A$ and $B$ are related as:

$$
\Delta U=q \Delta V
$$

Thus, the potential difference between the two points can be defined as the difference of the potential energy per unit charge.

An ECG records the "voltage" between points on human skin generated by electrical process in the heart. This ECG is made in running position providing information about the heart's performance under stress.

As the unit of P.E. is joule, Eq. 9.20 shows that the unit of potential difference is joule per coulomb. It is called volt such that,

$$
1 \text { volt }=\frac{1 \text { joule }}{1 \text { coulomb }}
$$

That is, a potential difference of 1 volt exists between two points if work done in moving a 1 coulomb positive charge from one point to the other, keeping electrostatic equilibrium, is one joule.
In order to give a concept of electric potential at a point in an electric field, we must have a reference to which we assign zero electric potential. This point is usually taken at infinity. Thus, in Eq. 9.20, if we take point A to be at infinity and choose $V_{0}=0$, the electric potential at $B$ will be $V_{0}=\frac{W_{0}}{q}$. Generally,

$$
V=\frac{W}{q}
$$

Why is it advised to wear rubber soled shoes while handing electricappliances?
which states that the electric potential at any point in an electric field is equal to the work done in bringing a unit positive charge from infinity to that point keeping it in electrostatic equilibrium. So, the potential at a point is always relative to potential at infinity. Both potential and potential differences are scalar quantities because both $W$ and $q$ are scalars.

# Electric Field as Potential Gradient 

In this section, we will establish a relation between electric intensity and potential difference. Let us consider the situation shown in Fig. 9.17. The electric field between the two charged plates is uniform and its value is $E$. The potential difference between A and B is given by the equation:

$$
V_{A}-V_{A}=\frac{W_{A B}}{q}
$$

where $W_{A B}=F d=-q E d$ (the negative sign is needed because $F$ must be applied opposite to $q E$ so as to keep it in equilibrium). With this, Eq. 9.24 becomes:

$$
V_{A}-V_{A}=\frac{-q E d}{q}=-E d
$$

or $E-\frac{\left(V_{A}-V_{A}\right)}{d}=-\frac{\Delta V}{d}$
If the plates $A$ and $B$ are separated by infinitesimally small distance $\Delta d$, the Eq. 9.25 is modified as:

$$
E=-\frac{\Delta V}{\Delta d}
$$

The quantity $\Delta V / \Delta d$ gives the maximum value of the rate of change of potential with distance because the charge has been moved along a field line in which the

## Time

In electrooncophalography the potential deference created by the electrical activity of the brain are used for diagnosing abnormalbehavior.

# Physics II 

distance $\Delta d$ between the two plates is minimum. It is known as potential gradient. Thus, the electric field intensity is equal to the negative of the gradient of electric potential. The negative sign indicates that the direction of $E$ is along the decreasing potential.
The unit of electric intensity from Eq.9.26 is volt/metre $\left(\mathrm{V} \mathrm{m}^{-1}\right)$ which is equal to $\mathrm{N} \mathrm{C}^{-1}$ as given below:

$$
1 \frac{\text { volt }}{\text { metre }}=1 \frac{\text { joule/coulomb }}{\text { metre }}=1 \frac{\text { newton } \times \text { metre }}{\text { metre } \times \text { coulomb }}=1 \frac{\text { newton }}{\text { coulomb }}=1 \mathrm{NC}^{-1}
$$

Example 9.4 Two parallel metal plates are 1.0 cm apart. These are connected to a battery of 12 volts. Find the magnitude of electric field intensity between them.

## Solution

Hera, $\Lambda V=12 \mathrm{~V}, \Lambda d=1.0 \mathrm{~cm}=1 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~m}, E=$ ?
Using the equation $\quad E=\frac{\Delta V}{\Delta d}$
Substituting the values,

$$
E=\frac{12 \mathrm{~V}}{1 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m}}=1200 \mathrm{~V} \mathrm{~m}^{-1}
$$

Example 9.5 Two horizontal parallel metal plates are connected to a 12 volt battery. An electron is released from the negative plate. Determine its velocity as it reaches the positive plate. Mass of electron $=9.1 \times 10^{-11} \mathrm{~kg}$ and charge $=q=e=1.6 \times 10^{-16} \mathrm{C}$.

## Solution

The electron is repelled by the negative plate and attracted by the positive plate. It will be accelerated towards positive plate. Therefore, its P.E. will be lost that will be converted into its K.E.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Loss of } P . E & =\text { Gain in } K . E \\
\Delta V \times e & =\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

Submitting the values,

$$
\begin{aligned}
12 \mathrm{~V} \times 1.6 \times 10^{19} \mathrm{C} & =\frac{1}{2} \times 9.1 \times 10^{-31} \mathrm{~kg} \times v^{2} \\
v^{2} & =4.2 \times 10^{12} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2} \\
v & =2.1 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

### 9.6 ELECTRON VOLT

We know that when a particle of charge $q$ moves from point $A$ at potential $V_{A}$ to a point $B$ at potential $V_{B}$ keeping electrostatic equilibrium, the change in potential energy $\Lambda U$ of particle is:

$$
\Delta U=q\left(V_{B}-V_{A}\right)=q \Delta V
$$

If no external force acts on the charge to maintain equilibrium, this change in P.E. appears in the form of change in $K . E$.
Suppose charge carried by the particle is $q=e=1.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C}$.
Thus, in this case, the energy acquired by the charge will be:

$$
\Delta K . E .-q \Delta V-e \Delta V-\left(1.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C}\right)(\Delta V)
$$

Moreover, assume that $\Delta V=1$ volt, hence,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Delta K . E .=q \Delta V=\left(1.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C}\right) \times(1 \mathrm{volt}) \\
& \Delta K . E .=\left(1.6 \times 10^{-19}\right) \times(\mathrm{CxV})=1.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{~J}
\end{aligned}
$$

The amount of energy equal to $1.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{~J}$ is called one electron-volt and is denoted by 1 eV . It is defined as "the amount of energy acquired or lost by an electron as it traverses a potential difference of one volt". Thus,

$$
1 \mathrm{eV}=1.6 \times 10^{19} \mathrm{~J}
$$

Example 9.6 A particle carrying a charge of $2 e$ falls through a potential difference of 3.0 V . Calculate the energy required by it.

$$
\text { Solution } \quad q=2 e, \Delta V=3.0 \mathrm{~V}
$$

The energy acquired by the particle is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta U=q \Delta V & =(2 e)(3.0 \mathrm{~V})=6.0 \mathrm{eV} \\
\Delta U & =6.0 \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{~J}=9.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{~J}
\end{aligned}
$$

# 9.7 MOTION OF CHAROED PARTICLES IN A UNIFORM ELECTRIC FIELD 

Two oppositely charged parallel metal plates produce uniform electric field between them. The direction of electricfieid is from positive to negative plate. A positive charge $+q$ placed in the field will move in the direction of electric field whereas a negative charge $-q$ will move opposite to the electric field. The magnitude of electric force acting on a charge qis represented in Fig 9.18 given by

$$
F=q E
$$

where $E$ is the electric intensity of the uniform electric field. If $V$ is the potential difference between the plates and $d$ is the separation of plates, then

$$
E=\frac{V}{d}
$$

[Image removed]

Fig. 9.18

To understand the effect of uniform electric field on the motion of charged particles, let us consider an electron placed between the two plates. The electron accelerates towards the positive plate due to a force $F$ acting on it.

For example, let $V=20 \mathrm{~V}, d=2.0 \mathrm{~cm}=2 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~m}$, the magnitude of $E$ will be:

$$
E=\frac{V}{d}=\frac{20 \mathrm{~V}}{2 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~m}^{-1}}=1000 \mathrm{~V} \mathrm{C}^{-1}
$$

The acceleration for the electron will be given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
& F=m a \\
& a=\frac{F}{m}=\frac{q E}{m}
\end{aligned}
$$

The charge on an electron $q=e=1.6 \times 10^{-12} \mathrm{C}$ and mass of electron $m=9.1 \times 10^{-21} \mathrm{~kg}$. So,

$$
a=\frac{1.6 \times 10^{-12} \mathrm{C} \times 1000 \mathrm{~V} \mathrm{C}^{-1}}{9.1 \times 10^{-21} \mathrm{~kg}}=1.76 \times 10^{14} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{2}
$$

If the electron is released from the negative plate, the velocity gained by it when it reaches positive plate can be found by the third equation of mation.

$$
2 a S=v_{f}^{2}-v_{f}^{2}
$$

Here

$$
S=d=2 \times 10^{2} \mathrm{~m}, v_{1}=0, v_{f}=v=?
$$

Putting the values in the above equation

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 2 \times 1.76 \times 10^{14} \mathrm{~ms}^{-2} \times 2 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~m}=v^{2} \\
& v^{2}=7.04 \times 10^{12} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{2} \\
& v=2.65 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

# 9.8 PATH OF A CHARGED PARTICLE 

The path of a charged particle is determined by the electric field in the region. The path is typically straight if the field is uniform and the charged particle is moving along the field. However, if a charged particle enters perpendicularly to the uniform field between the oppositely charged parallel plates with a certain velocity as shown in Fig. 9.19, it will not go straight. Its path will be parabolic just like a projectile thrown horizontally in the gravitational field. The horizontal component of the velocity of the charged particle remains constant whereas vertical component is accelerated due to the electric force.
Figure 9.19 shows that a positivity charged particle is attracted towards the negatively charged plate and thus undergoes deflection in that direction.

On the other hand, a negatively charged particle is attracted towards the positively charged plate and experiences deflection in that direction.

# 9.9 SHIELDING FROM EXTERNAL ELECTRIC FIELD 

An English scientist Michael Faraday invented a structure in 1836, called Faraday cage or Faraday shield. Faraday cage is an enclosure that blocks the external electric fields in conductive materials. It acts like a hollow conductor where devices or objects can be put for protection from electrical external fields. Any electrical shock received by the cage runs through its outer surface without causing any harm inside. The electric field inside the hollow conductor remains zero.
To understand the working of Faraday cage, suppose that a piece of conductor (say copper) carries a number of free electrons. Each electron will experience a force of repulsion because of the electric field of its neighbouring electrons. As a consequence, all the electrons rush to the surface of the conductor. Once static equilibrium is established with all of the excess charges on the surface, no further movement of charge occurs. If some electrons shift from the conductor to another object due to friction etc., a net positive charge appears on the surface of the conductor. We can say,

At equilibrium under electrostatic conditions, any
excess charge resides on the surface of a conductor.
Now consider the interior of the hollow conductor. The excess charges arrange themselves on the conductor's surface precisely in the manner that the total field within the interior becomes zero. In other words,
The conductor shields any charge within it from electric fields outside the conductor.
To eliminate the interference of external fields, circuits are often enclosed within metal boxes that provide shielding from such fields.
Figure 9.20 shows another aspect of how conductors alter the electric field lines created by external charges.
[Image removed]

Fig. 9.20

The lines are altered because the electric field just outside the surface of a conductor is perpendicular to the surface at equilibrium under electrostatic conditions. If the field were not perpendicular, there would be a component of the field parallel to the surface. Since the free electrons on the surface of the conductor can move, they would do so under the force exerted by the parallel component. But in reality, no electron flow occurs at equilibrium. Therefore, there can be no parallel component, and the electric field is perpendicular to the surface.
The principle of Faraday cage demands a material that contains a lot of free electrons that can move freely to the surface of the material. Only the conductors have free

electrons whereas insulators do not contain free electron, so the insulators can not be used to construct Faraday cage.
A good example of Faraday cage in our daily life is that of cars. The chassis and bodies of cars protect people inside due to its metal framed structure during the thunderstorms. The electrical charge travels over the metal surface of the vehicle into the ground and prevent the passengers inside.
A metal body of the microwave oven acts as a Faraday cage. Thus, they prevent the microwaves in an oven from expanding into the environment. Metal frame of an airplane also acts as a Faraday cage. When lightning strikes an airplane, electricity is distributed along its metal frame surface that keeps passengers and all devices inside the airplane safe.

# 9.10 ELECTRIC CURRENT 

Usually, it is said that electric current is the flow of charge. Let us see what actually flows in a conductor. The charge carriers are the free electrons. When the ends of a conductor are connected to a battery or some other source of potential, an electric field is set up at every point within the conductor. The free electrons experience a force in the direction of -E and they start moving. As the free electrons are bumping among the atoms, so they are not accelerated in a straight line under this force. They keep on colliding with the atoms of the conductor. The overall effect of these collisions is to transfer the energy of accelerated eletrons to the lattice with the result that the electrons acquire an average velocity, called the drift velocity in the direction of -E . The drift velocity is of the order of $10^{-4} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This drift velocity of electrons forms the electric current. The slow drift velocity does not mean that it takes long time for an electric current to set up. We know that as soon as we switch ON a bulb, itlitup immediately.
The reason is that on turning the switch ON, all the free electrons in the circuit start drifting. They repel the neighbouring ones and the disturbance propagates along the wire almost instantaneously. That is why, the electric current is set up very rapidly.
If a net charge $Q$ passes through any cross-section of a conductor in time $t$, the current $I$ flowing through it is:

$$
I=\frac{Q}{T}
$$

The SI unit of current is ampere (A) and it is the current due to flow of one coulomb charge per second through any cross-section of a conductor. If the charges move around a circuit in the same direction at all times, the current is said to be direct current (D.C). For example, batteries produce direct current. If the charges move first one way and then the opposite way, changing direction in regular intervals, the current is said to be alternating current (A.C). Mostly the electric generators produce A.C. The electricity supplied to our homes, offices, factories etc., by power stations is an A.C.

## Conventional Current

As we now understand, the electric current is due to flow of electrons through the metal

wires, but early scientists believed that electric current was due to flow of positive charges. The scientists have kept the convention and take the direction of current flow to be the direction in which positive charges would move. We call it conventional current.

Conventional current is hypothetical flow of positive charges that would have the same effect in the circuit as the flow of negative charges that actually does occur.

In Fig. 9.21, negative electrons arrive at the positive terminal of the battery. The same effect would have been achieved if an equivalent amount of positive charge has left the positive terminal. Therefore, we can say that the conventional current flows from positive terminal towards the negative terminal of a battery. A conventional current is consistent with our earlier use of a positive test charge for

defining electric fields and potential. The direction of conventional current is always from a point of higher potential towards a point of lower potential that is from the positive terminal towards the negative terminal. Now onward the current / always means the conventional current.

# 9.11 CURRENT THROUGH A CONDUCTOR 

Consider a segment of the current carrying conductor having length $L$ and area of crosssection $A$. The volume of the segment is $A L$, as represented in Fig. 9.22. Let $n$ be the number of charge carriers per unit volume, then total number of charge carriers in the segment at any time are $n A L$. If the charge on a charge carrier is $q$, the total change present

Usually, the charge carriers in a conductor are free electrons which have negative charge.
Suppose that charge carriers move towards left face of the segment when a potential difference is applied across the conductor. Then electric current is set up in the conductor directed towards right face. Assuming that drift velocity of the charge carries to be $v$, the time taken $t$ by all the charge carriers originally present in the

or

(1) Example 9.7 A copper wire has a cross-sectional area of $2 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ and carries a current of 3 A . If the number of elections per unit volume is $8.5 \times 10^{10} \mathrm{~m}^{3}$, calculate the drift velocity of the electrons in the wire. Charge on an electron is $1.6 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{C}$.

### 9.12 OHM'S LAW

When a potential difference $V$ is applied across the ends of a conductor, a current / starts flowing through it. The Ohm'slaw states that:

The current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the potential difference applied across the conductor, provided there is no charge in the physical state of the conductor.
Mathematically,

$$
\begin{array}{lll} 
& I \propto V & \text { or } \quad V \propto I \\
\text { or } & V=I R & (9.34)
\end{array}
$$

where $R$ is a constant of proportionality known as resistance of the conductor. The SI unit of resistance is ohm denoted by the Greek capital letter omega ( $\Omega$ ), and is defined as:

The resistance of a conductor is 1 ohm if a current of 1 ampere flows through it when a potential difference of 1 volt is applied across its ends.

### 9.13 RESISTIVITY AND ITS DEPENDENCE UPON TEMPERATURE

It has been experimentally seen that the resistance $R$ of a wire is directly proportional to

its length $L$ and inversely proportional to its cross sectional area $A$. Mathematically,

$$
R \propto \frac{L}{A}
$$

$$
R=\rho \frac{L}{A}
$$

where $p$ (rho) is a constant of proportionality known as resistivity or specific resistance of the material of the wire. It may be noted that resistance is the characteristic of a particular wire whereas the resistivity is the property of the material of which the wire is made. From Eq. 9.35, we have

$$
\rho=\frac{R A}{L}
$$

The above equation gives the definition of resistivity as the resistance of a metre cube of a material. The SI unit of resistivity is ohm-metre ( $\Omega \mathrm{m}$ )
Conductance is another quantity used to describe the electrical properties of materials. In fact, conductance is the reciprocal of resistance, i.e.

$$
\text { Conductance }=\frac{1}{\text { Resistance }}, G=\frac{1}{R}, G \text { is the conductance. }
$$

Mathematically, conductivity, $\sigma$ (sigma) is the reciprocal of resistivity ( $\rho$ ), i.e.

$$
\sigma=\frac{1}{\rho}
$$

The SI unit of conductivity is ohm " $m$ " or mho m". Resistivity of various materials is given in Table 9.2. It may be noted from Table 9.2 that silver and copper are two best conductors. That is the reason, most of electric wires are made of copper.
The resistivity of a substance depends upon the temperature also. It can be explained by recalling that the resistance offered by a conductor to the flow of electric current is due to collisions, which the free electrons encounter with atoms of the lattice. As the temperature of the conductor rises, the amplitude of vibration of the atoms in the lattice increases and hence, the probability of their collision with free electrons also increases. One may say that the atoms then offer a bigger target, that is the collision cross-section of the atoms increases with temperature. This makes the collisions between free electrons and the atoms in the lattice more frequent and hence, the resistance of the conductor increases.

# Physica II 

Experimentally, the change in resistance of a metallic conductor with temperature is found to be nearly linear over a considerable range of temperature above and below $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (Fig.9.23). Over such a range the fractional change in resistance per kelvin is known as the temperature coefficient ( $\alpha$ ) of resistance, i.e.

$$
\alpha=\frac{R_{i}-R_{0}}{R_{0} t}
$$

where $R_{0}$ and $R_{i}$ are resistances at temperatures $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $t^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ respectively. As resistivity $\rho$ depends upon the temperature, Eq. 9.35 gives

$$
R_{i}=\eta \frac{L}{A} \text { and } R_{0}=\eta \frac{L}{A}
$$

Substituting the values of $R_{i}$ and $R_{0}$ in Eq. 9.39, we have

$$
\alpha=\frac{\eta-\rho_{0}}{\rho_{0} t}
$$

where $\rho_{0}$ is the resistivity of a conductor at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $\rho_{i}$ is the resistivity at $t^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Values of temperature coefficients of resistance of some substances are also listed in Table 9.2. There are some substances like germanium, silicon, etc. whose resistance decreases with increase in temperature, these substances have negative temperature coefficients.

## For your information

Inspectors can easily check the reliability of a concrete bridge made with carbon fibers. The fibers conduct electricity. If sensors show that electrical resistance is increasing over time the fibers are separating because of cracks.

Example 9.8 0.75 A current flows through an iron wire when a battery of 1.5 V is connected across its ends. The length of the wire is 5.0 m and its cross-sectional area is $2.5 \times 10^{-1} \mathrm{~m}^{2}$. Compute the resistivity of iron.

## Solution

The resistance $R$ of the wire can be calculated by Eq. 9.34 i.e.,

$$
R=\frac{V}{i}=\frac{1.5 \mathrm{~V}}{0.75 \mathrm{~A}}=2.0 \mathrm{VA}^{\prime}=2.0 \Omega
$$

The resistivity $\rho$ of iron of which the wire is made of is given by

$$
\rho=R \frac{A}{L}=\frac{2.0 \Omega \times 2.5 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~m}^{2}}{5.0 \mathrm{~m}}=1.0 \times 10^{-1} \Omega \mathrm{~m}
$$

Example 9.9 A platinum wire has resistance of $10 \Omega$ at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $20 \Omega$ at $193^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Find the value of temperature coefficient of resistance of platinum.

$$
R_{0}=10 \Omega, R_{i}=20 \Omega, t=466 \mathrm{~K}-273 \mathrm{~K}=193 \mathrm{~K}
$$

Temperature coefficient of resistance can be found by

$$
\alpha=\frac{R_{f}-R_{0}}{R_{0} t}=\frac{20 \Omega-10 \Omega}{10 \Omega \times 193 \mathrm{~K}}=\frac{1}{193 \mathrm{~K}}=5.18 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}
$$

# 9.14 ELECTRICAL POWER 

Consider a circuit consisting of a battery of emf $\varepsilon$ connected in series with a resistance $R$ (Fig. 9.24). A steady current flows through the circuit and a steady potential difference $V$ exists between the terminals $A$ and $B$ of the resistor $R$. Terminal $A$, connected to the positive pole of the battery, is at a higher potential than the terminal B. In this circuit the battery is continuously lifting charge uphill through the potential difference $V$. Using the meaning of potential difference, the work done in moving a charge $Q$ up through the potential difference $V$ is given by

$$
\text { Work done }=W=V \times Q \text {. } \\
\text { This is the energy supplied by the battery. }

The rate at which the battery is supplying electrical energy is the power output or electrical power of the battery. Using the definition of power, we have

\text { Electrical power } & =\frac{\text { Energy supplied }}{\text { Time taken }}=V \frac{Q}{t} \\
\text { Since } \quad I & =\frac{Q}{t}
\end{aligned}
$$

The above equation can also be written as:

$$
\text { Electrical power }=V I \text {. }

Fig. 9.24: The power of a battery appears as the power dissipated in the resistance $R$.

Equation 9.42 is a general relation for power delivered from a source of current $I$ operating on a voltage $V$. In the circuit shown in Fig. 9.24 the power supplied by the battery is expended or dissipated in the resistor $R$. The principle of conservation of energy tells us that the power dissipated in the resistor is also given by Eq. 9.42.

Power dissipated $P=V I$
Alternative equation for calculating power can be found by substituting $V=I R, I=V / R$ in turn in Eq. 9.42.
or

$$
P=V I=(I R) I=I^{2} R
$$

$$
P=V I=V(V / R)=V^{2} / R
$$

Thus, we have three equations for calculating the power dissipated in a resistor.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& P=V I, \quad P=I^{2} R \\
& P=V^{2} / R
\end{aligned}
$$

If $V$ Is expressed in volts and $I$ in amperes, the power is expressed in watts.

### 9.15 ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE (EMF) AND POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE

We know that a source of electrical energy, say a cell or a battery, when connected across a resistance, maintains a steady current through it Fig. 9.25. The cell

continuously supplies energy which is dissipated in the resistance of the circuit. Suppose when a steady current has been established in the circuit, a charge $Q$ passes through any cross-section of the circuit in time $t$. During the course of motion, this charge enters the cell at its low potential end and leaves at its high potential end. The source must supply energy $W$ to the positive charge to compel it to go to the point of high potential. The emf $E$ of the source is defined as the energy supplied to unit charge by the cell.

$$
E=\frac{W}{Q}
$$

[Image removed]

Fig. 9.25: Electromotive force of a cell

It may be noted that electromotive force is not a force and we do not measure it in newtons. The unit of emf is joule/coulomb which is volt (V). The energy supplied by the cell to the charge carriers is derived from the conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy inside the cell.
Like other components in a circuit, a cell also offers some resistance. This resistance is due to the electrolyte present between the two electrodes of the cell and is called the internal resistance of the cell. Thus, a cell of emf $E$ having an internal resistance $r$ is equivalent to a source of pure emf $E$ with a resistance $r$ in series as shown in Fig. 9.26.
Let us consider the performance of a cell of emf $E$ and internal resistance $r$ as shown in Fig.9.27. A voltmeter of infinite resistance measures the potential difference across the external resistance $R$ or the potential difference $V$ across the terminals of the cell. The current $I$ flowing through the circuit is given by

$$
I=\frac{E}{R+r}
$$

$$
E=I R+I r \ldots \ldots \ldots(9.45)
$$

Here $I R=V$ is the terminal potential difference of the cell in the presence of current $I$. When the switch $S$ is open, no current passes through the resistance. In this case, the voltmeter reads the emf $E$ as terminal voltage. Thus, terminal voltage in the presence of the current (switch ON) would be less than the emf Eby Ir.
[Image removed]

A voltmeter connected across the terminals of a cell measures:
(a) the emf of the cell on open circuit,
(b) the tarminal potential difference on a closed circuit.

Let us interpret the Eq. 9.45 on energy considerations. The left side of this equation is the emf $E$ of the cell which is equal to energy gained by unit charge as it passes through the cell from its negative to positive terminal. The right side of the equation gives an account of the utilization of this energy as the current passes the circuit. It states that, as a unit charge passes through the circuit, a part of this energy equal to irle dissipated into the cell and the rest of the energy is dissipated into the external resistance $R$. It is given by potential drop $I R$. Thus, the emf gives the energy supplied to unit charge by the cell and the potential drop across the various elements account for the dissipation of this energy into other forms as the unit charge passes through these elements.
The emf is the "cause" and potential difference is its "effect". The emf is always present even when no current is drawn through the battery or the cell, but the potential difference across the conductor is zero when no current flows through it.

Example 9.10 The potential difference between the terminals of a battery in open circuit is 2.2 V . When it is connected across a resistance of $5.0 \Omega$, the potential falls to 1.8 V . Calculate the current and the internal resistance of the battery.

Solution

$$
E=2.2 \mathrm{~V}, \quad R=5.0 \Omega, \quad V=1.8 \mathrm{~V}
$$

We have to calculate $I$ and $r$
Using

$$
V=I R \quad \text { or } \quad I=\frac{V}{R}=\frac{1.8 \mathrm{~V}}{5.0 \Omega}=0.36 \mathrm{~A}
$$

Internal resistance $r$ can be calculated by using

$$
\begin{aligned}
E & =V+i r \\
2.2 V & =1.8 \mathrm{~V}+0.36 \mathrm{Ax} r
\end{aligned}
$$

or
$r=1.1 \Omega$

# 9.16 KIRCHHOFF'S RULES 

Kirchhoff's rules are two fundamental principles in circuit analysis that help to determine the current and voltage in electrical circuits. They are particularly useful for analysing complex circuits that cannot be simplified by Ohm's law and series or parallel combinations.

## Kirchhoff's First Rule

It states that the sum of all the currents meeting at a point in the circuit is zero.
i.e., $\quad 27=0$
It is a convention that a current flowing towards a point is taken as positive and that flowing away from a point is taken as negative.

For your information
A node is a point in an electric circuit which joins the two or more branches.

Consider a situation where four wires meet at a point $A$ (Fig.9.28). The currents flowing into the point $A$ sre $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ and currents flowing away from the point are $I_{3}$ and $I_{4}$.
According to the convention, currents $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ are positive and currents $I_{3}$ and $I_{4}$ are negative. Applying Eq. 9.48 , we have

$$
I_{1}+I_{2}+\left(-I_{3}\right)+\left(-I_{4}\right)=0
$$

or

$$
I_{1}+I_{2}=I_{3}+I_{4}
$$

Using Eq.9.47, Kirchhoff's first rule can be stated in other words as:

The sum of all the currents flowing towards a point is equal to the sum of all the currents flowing away from the point.
[Image removed]

Fig. 9.28: According to Kirchhoff's $1^{\text {st }}$ rule $I_{1}+I_{2}=I_{3}+I_{4}$

## Deved know?

The node at which potential is taken as zero is called datum node or reference node.

Kirchhoff's first rule which is also known as Kirchhoff's point rule is a manifestation of law of conservation of charge. If there is no sink or source of charge at a point, the total charge flowing towards the point must be equal to the total charge flowing away from it.

# Kirchhoff's Second Rule 

It states that the algebraic sum of voltage changes in a closed circuit or a loop must be equal to zero. Consider a closed circuit shown in Fig. 9.29. The direction of the current / flowing through the circuit depends on the cell having the greater emf. Suppose $E_{1}$ is greater than $E_{2}$, so the current flows in counter clockwise direction. We know that a steady current is equivalent to a continuous flow of positive charges through the circuit. We also know that a voltage change or potential difference is equal to the work done on a unit positive charge or energy gained or lost by it in moving from one point to the other. Thus, when a positive charge $Q$ due to the current $I$ in the closed circuit (Fig.9.29), passes through the cell $E_{1}$ from low (-ve) to high potential ( +ve ), it gains energy because work is done on it. Using Eq. 9.44 the energy gain is $E_{1} Q$. When the current passes through the cell $E_{2}$, it loses energy equal to $-E_{2} Q$ because here the charge passes from high to low potential. In going through the resistor $R_{1}$, the charge $Q$ loses energy equal to $-I R_{1} Q$ where $I R_{1}$ is potential difference across $R_{1}$. The minus sign shows that the charge is passing from high to low potential. Similarly, the loss of energy while passing through the resistor $R_{2}$ is $-I R_{2} Q$. Finally, the charge reaches the negative terminal of the cell $E_{2}$ from where we started. According to the law of conservation of energy, the total change in energy of our system is zero. Therefore, we can write:

$$
E_{1} Q-I R_{1} Q-E_{2} Q-I R_{2} Q=0
$$

or

$$
E_{1}-I R_{1}-E_{2}-I R_{2}=0
$$

[Image removed]

Fig. 9.29: According to Kirchhoff's $2^{\text {nd }}$ rule $E_{1}-I R_{1}-E_{2}-I R_{2}=0$

which is Kirchhoff's second rule and it states that:
The algebraic sum of potential changes in a closed circuit is zero.
We have seen that this rule is simply a particular way of stating the law of conservation of energy in electrical problems.
Before applying this rule for the analysis of complex network, it is worthwhile to thoroughly understand the rules for finding the potential changes.
(i) If a source of emf is traversed from positive to negative terminal, the potential change is positive. It is negative in the opposite direction.
[Image removed]
(ii) If a resistor is traversed in the direction of current, the change in potential is positive. It is negative in the opposite direction.
Example 9.11 Calculate the currents in the three resistances of the circuit shown in Fig. 9.30.

# Solution 

First we select two loops abcda and ebcfe. The choice of loops is quite arbitrary, but it should be such that each resistance is included at least once in the selected loops.
[Image removed]

Fig. 9.30

After selecting the loops, suppose a current $I_{1}$ is flowing in the first loop and $I_{2}$ in the second loop, all flowing in the same sense. These currents are called loop currents. The actual currents will be calculated with their help. It should be noted that the sense of the current flowing in all loops should essentially be the same. It may be clockwise or anticlockwise. Here we have assumed it to be clockwise.
We now apply Kirchhoff's second rule to obtain the equations required to calculate the currents through the resistances. We first consider the loop abcda. Starting at point a we follow the loop clockwise. The voltage change while crossing the battery $E_{1}$ is $-E_{1}$ because the current flows through it from positive to negative. The voltage change across $R_{1}$ is $-I_{1} R_{1}$. The resistance $R_{2}$ is common to both the loops $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$, therefore, the currents $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ simultaneously flow through it. The directions of currents $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ as flowing through $R_{2}$ are opposite, so we have to decide that which of these currents is to be assigned a positive sign. The convention regarding the sign of the current is that if we are applying the Kirchhoff's second rule in the first loop, then the current of this loop i.e., $I_{1}$ will be assigned a positive sign and all currents flowing opposite to $I_{1}$ have a negative sign. Similarly, while applying Kirchhoff's second rule in the second loop, the current $I_{2}$ will be considered as positive and $I_{1}$ as negative. Using this convention the current

flowing through $R_{2}$ is $\left(I_{1}-I_{2}\right)$ and the voltage change across is $-\left(I_{1}-I_{2}\right) R_{2}$. The voltage change across the battery $E_{2}$ is $E_{2}$. Thus, the Kirchhoff's second rule as applied to the loop abode gives

$$
-E_{1}-I_{1} R_{1}-\left(I_{1}-I_{2}\right) R_{2}+E_{2}=0
$$

Substituting the values, we have

$$
\begin{gathered}
-40 \mathrm{~V}-I_{1} \times 10 \Omega-\left(I_{1}-I_{2}\right) \times 30 \Omega+60 \mathrm{~V}=0 \\
20 \mathrm{~V}-10 \Omega \times\left[I_{1}+3\left(I_{1}-I_{2}\right)\right]=0 \\
4 I_{1}-3 I_{2}=2 \mathrm{~V} \Omega^{1}=2 \mathrm{~A} \\
4 I_{1}-3 I_{2}=2 \mathrm{~V} \Omega^{1}=2 \mathrm{~A}
\end{gathered}
$$

Similarly, applying Kirchhoff's second rule to the loop ebote, we have

$$
-E_{2}-\left(I_{2}-I_{1}\right) R_{2}-I_{2} R_{2}+E_{2}=0
$$

Substituting the values

$$
\begin{gathered}
-60 \mathrm{~V}-\left(I_{2}-I_{1}\right) \times 30 \Omega-I_{2} \times 15 \Omega+50 \mathrm{~V}=0 \\
-10 \mathrm{~V}-15 \Omega \times\left[I_{2}+2\left(I_{2}-I_{1}\right)\right]=0 \\
6 I_{1}-9 I_{2}=2 \mathrm{~V} \Omega^{1}=2 \mathrm{~A}
\end{gathered}
$$

Solving Eq.(i) and Eq. (ii) for $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$, we have

$$
I_{1}=0.86 \AA \text { and } I_{2}=0.22 \mathrm{~A}
$$

Knowing the value of loop currents $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ the actual current flowing through each resistance of the circuit can be determined. Fig. 9.29 shows that $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ are the actual currents through the resistances $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$. The actual current through $R_{2}$ is the difference of $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ and its direction is along the larger current. Thus,
The current through $R_{1}=I_{1}=2 / 3 A=0.66$ A flowing in the direction of $I_{1}$ i.e., from a to d.
The current through $R_{2}=I_{1}-I_{2}=2 / 3 A-2 / 9 A=0.44$ A flowing in the direction of $I_{1}$ i.e., from cto b.
The current through $R_{2}=I_{2}=2 / 9 A=0.22$ A flowing in the direction of $I_{1}$ i.e., from $f$ to e.

# Procedures of Solution of Circuit Problems 

After solving the above problem, we are in a position to apply the same procedure to analyse other direct current complex networks. While using Kirchhoff's rules in other problems, it is worthwhile to follow the approach given below:
(i) Draw the circuit diagram.
(ii) The choice of loops should be such that each resistance is included at least once in the selected loops.
(iii) Assume a loop current in each loop. All the loop currents should be in the same sense. It may be either clockwise or anticlockwise.
(iv) Write the loop equations for all the selected loops. For writing each loop equation, the voltage change across any component is positive if traversed from low to high

potential and it is negative if traversed from high to low potential.
(v) Solve these equations for the unknown quantities.

# 9.17 WHEATSTONE BRIDGE 

It is an electric circuit. The Wheatstone bridge circuit shown in Fig. 9.31 consists of four resistances $R_{1}, R_{2}, R_{3}$ and $R_{4}$ connected in such a way so as to form a mesh ABCDA. A battery is connected between points $A$ and $C$. A sensitive galvanometer of resistance $R_{2}$ is connected between points $B$ and $D$. If the switch $S$ is closed, a current will flow through the galvanometer. We have to determine the condition under which no current flows through the galvanometer even after the switch is closed. For this purpose, we analyse this circuit using Kirchhoff's second rule. We consider two loops ABDA and BCDB and assume anticlockwise loop currents $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ through the loops respectively. The Kirchhoff's second rule as applied to loop ABDA gives:
[Image removed]

Fig. 9.31: Wheatstone bridge circuit

$$
-I_{1} R_{1}-\left(I_{1}-I_{2}\right) R_{2}-I_{1} R_{3}=0
$$

Similarly, by applying the Kirchhoff's second rule to loop BCDB, we have

$$
-I_{2} R_{2}-I_{1} R_{1}-\left(I_{2}-I_{1}\right) R_{2}=0
$$

The current flowing through the galvanometer will be zero if, $I_{1}-I_{2}=0$ or $I_{1}=I_{2}$. With this condition Eq. 9.51 and Eq. 9.52 reduce to:

$$
-I_{2} R_{2}=I_{1} R_{3}
$$

and

$$
-I_{3} R_{2}=I_{1} R_{4}
$$

Dividing Eq. 9.48 by Eq. 9.49, we have

$$
\frac{-I_{1} R_{1}}{-I_{2} R_{2}}=\frac{I_{1} R_{3}}{I_{2} R_{4}}
$$

As $I_{1}=I_{2}$, therefore,

$$
\frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}}=\frac{R_{2}}{R_{4}}
$$

## Point to ponder!

Why is a three pin plug used in some electric appliances?

Thus, whenever the condition of Eq. 9.54 is satisfied, no current flows through the galvanometer and it shows no deflection, or conversely when the galvanometer in the Wheatstone bridge circuit shows no deflection, Eq. 9.54 is satisfied. If we connect three

resistances $R_{1}, R_{2}$ and $R_{3}$ of known adjustable values and a fourth resistance $R_{4}$ of unknown value and the resistances $R_{1}, R_{2}$ and $R_{3}$ are so adjusted that the galvanometer shows no deflection, then from the known resistances $R_{1}, R_{2}$ and $R_{3}$, the unknown resistance $R_{4}$ can be determined by using Eq. 9.54.

# 9.18 POTENTIOMETER 

A potentiometer is mainly used to compare potential differences and to find the value of an unknown resistance. It works on the principle of Wheatslone Bridge.

## Working of Potentiometer

Potential difference is usually measured by an instrument called a voltmeter. The voltmeter is connected across the two points in a circuit between which potential difference is to be measured. It is necessary that the resistance of the voltmeter be large compared to the circuit resistance across which the voltmeter is connected. Otherwise, an appreciable current will flow through the voltmeter which will alter the circuit current and the potential difference to be measured. Thus, the voltmeter can read the correct potential difference only when it does not draw any current from the circuit across which it is connected. An ideal voltmeter would have an infinite resistance.
However, there are some potential measuring instruments such as digital voltmeter and cathode-ray oscilloscope which practically do not draw any current from the circuit because of their large resistance and are thus very accurate potential measuring instruments. But these instruments are very expensive. A very simple instrument which can measure and compare potential differences accurately is a potentiometer.
A potentiometer consists of a resistor $R$ in the form of a wire on which a terminal $C$ can slide (Fig. 9.32-a). The resistance between $A$ and $C$ can be varied from 0 to $R$ as the sliding contact $C$ is moved from $A$ to $B$. If a battery of emf $E$ is connected across $R$ (Fig. 9.32-b) the current flowing through it is $I=E / R$. If we represent the resistance between $A$ and $C$ by $r$, the potential drop between these points will be $r I=r E / R$. Thus, as $C$ is moved from $A$ to $B, r$ varies from 0 to $R$ and the potential drop between $A$ and $C$ changes from 0 to $E$.
Such an arrangement also known as potential divider can be used to measure the unknown emf of a source by using the circuit shown in Fig. 9.33. Here $R$ is in the form of a straight wire of uniform area of cross-section. A source of potential, say a cell whose emf $E_{x}$ is to be
[Image removed]

Fig. 9.32

measured, is connected between $A$ and the sliding contact $C$ through a galvanometer $G$. It should be noted that the positive terminal of $E_{x}$ and that of the potential divider are connected to the same point $A$. If, in the loop AGCA, the point $C$ and the negative terminal of $E_{x}$ are at the same potential, then the two terminals of the galvanometer will be at the same potential and no current will flow through the galvanometer. Therefore, to measure the potential $E_{x}$, the position of $C$ is so adjusted that the galvanometer shows no deflection. Under this
[Image removed]

Fig. 9.33
condition, the emf $E_{x}$, of the cell is equal to the potential difference between $A$ and $C$ whose value $E_{x} / R$ is known. In case of a wire of uniform cross-section, the resistance is proportional to the length of the wire. Therefore, the unknown emf is also given by

$$
E_{x}=E \frac{\ell}{R}=E \frac{\ell}{L}
$$

where $L$ is the total length of the wire $A B$ and $\ell$ is its length from $A$ to $C$, after $C$ has been adjusted for no deflection. As the maximum potential that can be obtained between $A$ and $C$ is $E$, so the unknown emf $E_{x}$ should not exceed this value, otherwise the null condition will not be obtained. It can be seen that the unknown emf $E_{x}$ is determined when no current is drawn from it and therefore, potentiometer is one of the most accurate methods for measuring potential.
The method for measuring the emf of a cell as described above can be used to compare the emfs $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ of two cells. The balancing lengths $\ell$, and $\ell_{2}$ are found separately for the two cells. Then,

$$
E_{1}=E \frac{\ell_{1}}{L} \text { and } E_{2}=E \frac{\ell_{2}}{L}
$$

Dividing these two equations, we have

$$
\frac{E_{1}}{E_{2}}=\frac{\ell}{\ell_{2}}
$$

So, the ratio of the emfs is equal to ratio of the balancing lengths.

# 9.19 USE OF A GALVANOMETER 

A galvanometer is an instrument for detecting a current. We are not going to discuss its internal structure and how does it work. We focus only on its use. It is often used in null methods to achieve precise measurements in electrical circuits. The null method involves adjusting the circuit until the galvanometer shows no deflection i.e., a zero reading. This indicates that certain required conditions are met in the circuit. In this state, the electric potentials at both ends of the galvanometer are the same. Although a galvanometer has its own resistance, but at the null reading, its resistance does not

come into play. The reason is that, in this condition no current is passing through it. The null method is widely used in bridge circuits such as Wheatstone and potentiometer setups.
As we have studied in the previous section, the null method is used to measure an unknown resistance in the Wheatstone bridge circuits. The galvanometer is connected between the mid-points of opposite sides. The variable resistance is adjusted until the galvanometer shows no deflection. At this point, the bridge is balanced and the unknown resistance can be calculated using the ratio of the known resistances.
In a potentiometer, null method is used to measure an unknown voltage by comparison with a known reference voltage applied across the resistance wire of the potentiometer. A galvanometer and a jockey are used to make contact along the wire. At null point, the potential difference between the jockey and the end of the wire equals the unknown voltage. The position of the jockey gives the measure of the unknown voltage.
There are some advantages of using a galvanometer in null method.

1. Null method, eliminates the effect of the galvanometer's internal resistance on the measurement resulting in more accurate readings.
2. Galvanometers are highly sensitive and can detect very small currents of the order of $10^{4}$ ampere.
3. "No deflection" indicates a direct and clear condition of balance making it easier to identify the null point.

# 9.20 THERMISTORS 

A thermistor is a heat sensitive resistor. Most thermistors have negative temperature coefficient of resistance, i.e., the resistance of such thermistors decreases when their temperature is increased. Thermistors with positive temperature coefficient are also available.
In the thermistors, resistance decreases as temperature increases. This is because increasing temperature provides more energy to the charge carriers (electrons or holes), enabling them to move more freely and thus reducing resistance.
Thermistors are made by heating under high pressure semiconductor ceramic made from mixtures of metallic oxides of manganese, nickel, cobalt, copper, iron, etc. These are pressed into desired shapes and

Fig. 9.35: Types of thermistors

then baked at high temperature. Different types of thermistors are shown in Fig. 9.34. They may be in the form of beads, rods or washers.

# Applications of Thermistors 

## Temperature Measurement

Thermistors are used in thermometers, and electric devices such as air conditioners, refrigerators, heaters, microwave ovens, incubators, etc.to monitor temperature.
Thermistors with high negative temperature coefficient are very accurate for measuring low temperatures especially near 10 K . The higher resistance at low temperature enables more accurate measurement possible.
Thermistors have wide applications as temperature sensors, i.e. they convert changes of temperature into electrical voltage which is duly processed. For example, these are used in coolant temperature sensors in automobile engines to prevent the engine overheating and in digital thermometers.

## Temperature Compensation

Thermistors are used in circuits where temperature changes could affect performance. Such as in oscillators, battery charging circuits and power systems.

## Inrush Current Limiting

Thermistors are used to limit the initial flow of current when a device is first turned on.

## Voltage Divider

Thermistors are widely used as voltage divider. As shown in Fig. 9.36 when temperature of a thermistor increases, its resistance decreases. This decreases the voltage drop across the thermistor. As a result, the potential at point B increases that can be used to trigger a circuit connected to it. In case of a fire alarm, the use of a thermistor turns the NOT gate low when it gets heated. The output of NOT gate goes high and

### 9.21 LIGHT DEPENDENT RESISTOR

Light dependent resistor (LDR) is a resistor whose resistance decreases with increasing light intensity. Due to this property, it is also known as photo resistor. The LDRs are typically made from semiconductor material like cadmium sulphide. The material is deposited in a special pattern on an insulating plate.

## Working Principle

The principle used in an LDR is the increase in the conductivity of the material on exposing it to light. In darkness, the semiconductor material has a few free electrons (charge carriers) resulting in high resistance. When light photons hit the material, they

transfer energy to electrons in the outer orbits, thus, making them free to conduct electricity. This decreases the resistance of LDR. The amount of light hitting the LDR's surface determines the number of free elections. Conversely, less light results in lowering the free elections, thus, making higher resistance. This change in resistance can be measured and used in circuits to sense light levels.

# Applications of LDRs 

## Light Sensors

LDRs are commonly used in light sensing circuits such as automatic lighting systems in homes and street lights. An LDR works just like a switch that turns ON at dusk and OFF at dawn.

## Camera Exposure Control

LDRs help in adjusting the exposure time in cameras based on the amount of available light.

## Voltage Divider

In a typical circuit, an LDR can be a part of voltage divider, that converts the resistance change into measurable voltage change. This voltage can then be read by a microcontroller or other control circuitry to perform actions based on light levels. A circuit is shown in Fig. 9.37 in which an LDR is used as voltage divider. In the dark, the LDR has a very high resistance as compared to the standard resistance ( 100 kD ) in the circuit. Therefore the voltage drop across the LDR is very large as registered by a voltmeter. When the LDR is exposed to light, the resistance of LDR decreases to very low. Now, the voltmeter registers a lower reading. Hence, the change in light intensity gives rise to change in voltage. Therefore, by connecting mid-point B to a NOT gate, LDR can be used as a switch.

## Reliability of A Concrete Bridge

Inspectors can easily check the reliability of concrete bridge with the help of carbon fibers embedded in its slab. This is possible because of the conducting property of the carbon fibers. Let us know step by step how does it work?

1. First step is to know the electrical properties of carbon fibers. Carbon fibers are known to be good conductors of electricity due to their high carbon content.
2. Secondly, we can embed the carbon fibers within the slab of the concrete bridge during its construction.
[Image removed]

[Image removed]

Fig. 9.38: Carbon fibre sheets

Then we can connect them to form a conductors network.
3. Inspectors can check the reliability of the concrete bridge by applying small electric current to the carbon fiber network. They can determine the integrity of the concrete structure by measuring the resistance of the network.
4. The sensor installed into the network can show whether the electric resistance is changing or not. If the resistance remains the same over time, it indicates that the concrete bridge is maintaining its structural integrity. However, if the resistance increases, it means that the concrete is deteriorating or that the carbon fibers are being damaged.
Some other methods are also used to check the strength of the concrete bridge. For example, a type of sensors continuously monitor strain, vibration and temperature. Internal flaws, such as cracks or voids are detected by using ultrasound waves.

We have already studied that a magnetic field is produced around a current-carrying conductor. Also, a changing magnetic field gives rise to a current in a conductor placed in it. Electromagnetism is a key area of physics that studies how electric charges and magnetic fields interact.

## For your information

Magnetism started with todostone, a natural mineral discovered in ancient Törklyc. Lodestone, or magnetite $\left(\mathrm{Fe}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{4}\right)$, can attract metals like iron and steel and aligns with the Earth's magnetic poles, leading to the invention of the compass.

Electromagnetism is crucial for modern technology, including phones, computers, and medical devices. In this chapter, we will explore basic concepts like electric fields, magnetic forces, and electromagnetic induction, and see how these principles affect both natural phenomena and technology. Understanding these concepts help us appreciate how electromagnetism influences our world and drives innovation.

# 10.1 FORCE ON A CURRENT-CARRYING CONDUCTOR IN A UNIFORM MAGNETIC FIELD 

It has been observed experimentally that a current-carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field experiences a force. Consider a straight conductor carrying a steady current placed perpendicular to uniform magnetic field. Assume the direction of the current is out of the paper as shown by $\oplus$ in Fig. 10.2. The direction of magnetic field produced by the current is also shown.
Just as two magnets exert forces on each other through their magnetic fields, a current-carrying conductor experiences a force due to the interaction between its own magnetic field and the external magnetic field. To determine the direction of this force, consider the interaction between the two fields.
[Image removed]

Fig. 10.2

The magnetic field produced by the current and the external uniform magnetic field reinforce each other on the left side of the conductor and oppose each other on the right side. Consequently, the conductor moves towards the side where the field is weaker. That is, the force on the conductor is directed to the right as viewed from the front. Thus, the force $F$ is perpendicular to both the conductor and the magnetic field. Fleming's lefthand rule is used to predict the direction of the force experienced by a current-carrying conductor in a magneticfield. To apply the rule:

Position your left hand such that the first finger points in the direction of magnetic field, the second finger points in the direction of current, the thumb will then point in the direction of force.

The Fleming's left hand rule is illustrated in Fig. 10.3.
[Image removed]

Fig. 10.3

However, direction of force can also be found by using right hand rule that can be stated as:

Curl fingers of your right hand from current to magnetic field through smaller angle, the stretched thumb will indicate the direction of force.

Let us now determine the magnitude of the force on a current-carrying conductor placed inside a magnetic field. Experimentally, it has been observed that the magnitude of the force acting on the conductor is directly proportional to the current $I$ in the conductor, the length $L$ of the conductor, and the strength of the external magnetic field $B$. The strength of the magnetic field is also known as the magnetic induction $B$, which has the same direction as the field. Thus, the force $F$ on a conductor of length $L$, carrying a current $I$ and placed perpendicular to a magnetic field of strength $B$, is given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
& F \propto B / L \\
& F=k B / L
\end{aligned}
$$

In SI units, the value of $k=1$. Therefore,

$$
F=B / L
$$

From Eq. (10.1) we can see that $B=\frac{F}{I L}$, so we can define $B$ as:
The magnetic strength is numerically equal to the force exerted on a conductor of length one metre carrying one ampere current, placed perpendicular to the magnetic field.
Equation $B=\frac{F}{I L}$ also gives us the unit of $B$. The SI unit of $B$ is tesla (T).

$$
1 \mathrm{~T}=1 \mathrm{NA}^{\prime \prime} \mathrm{m}^{\prime \prime}
$$

It may be noted that magnetic induction is a vector quantity. Its direction is the same as that of magnetic field.
We can also consider a vector $L$ which has a magnitude equal to the length of the conductor and its direction is along the flow of current.

Isinil
Fig. 10.4

Now consider a conductor $L$ placed at an angle ' $\theta$ ' w.r.t the magnetic field, then we will use the component of $L$ perpendicular to $B$ i.e., ( $L$ sin $\theta$ ), as shown in Fig. 10.4. Then the Eq. (10.1) will become,

$$
F=B / L \sin \theta
$$

In the vector form the Eq. 10.2 can be written as

$$
F=I L \times B
$$

Equation (10.2) shows that the force will be maximum (B/L) when the conductor is perpendicular to the field, i.e., $\theta=90^{\circ}$, and it will be zero when the conductor is along the field i.e., $\theta=0$.

The Earth's magnetic field is approximately that of a dipole, like that of the fictitious bar magnet, where the south magnetic pole is towards the geographic north pole and the north magnetic pole is towards the geographic south pole.

Example 10.1 A 20.0 cm wire carrying a current of 10.0 A is placed in a uniform magnetic field of 0.30 T . If the wire makes an angle of $40^{\circ}$ with the direction of magnetic field, find the magnitude of the force acting on the wire.

$$
\text { Solution Length of the wire }=L=20.0 \mathrm{~cm}=0.20 \mathrm{~m}
$$

| Physica III |  | (a) | Chaster 10 |  |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Current | $=1$ | $=10.0 \mathrm{~A}$ |  |  |
| Strength of magnetic field |  | $=B=0.30 \mathrm{~T}$ |  |  |
| Angle |  | $=9=40^{\circ}$ |  |  |

Substituting the values in Eq. (10.2): $\quad F=10.0 \mathrm{A} \times 0.30 \mathrm{~T} \times 0.20 \mathrm{~m} \times \sin 40^{\circ}=0.39 \mathrm{~N}$

# 10.2 MAGNETIC FLUX AND FLUX DENSITY 

We can represent the strength of a magnetic field $B$ by the lines of force in the same way as for electric field. Then, the population of these lines in the field per unit area passing through a surface perpendicular to the field will represent the magnetic flux. Thus,
The magnetic flux through a patch of area $A$ is the number of magnetic lines passing through this area.
If $B$ represents the number of lines passing through unit area placed perpendicular to the field, then the total flux through area $A$ perpendicular to the field will be:

$$
B=\frac{\phi_{B}}{A}
$$

The surface $A$ may not be perpendicular to the field, that is the normal to the surface makes an angle $\theta$ with $B$ as shown in Fig. 10.5. Then, we will have to use component of $B$ (Bcos $\theta$ ) along the vector area $A$ (Fig. 10.6). Therefore, the flux passing through the surface will be:

$$
\phi_{B}=B A \cos \theta
$$

[Image removed]

Fig. 10.5

As $B$ and $A$ both are vectors, so we can write

$$
\phi_{B}=B \cdot A
$$

[Image removed]

Fig. 10.6

Equation (10.6) shows that $\phi_{B}$ is a scaler quantity. Therefore, we can define magnetic flux as:
The magnetic flux $\phi_{B}$, through a plane element of area A in a uniform magnetic field B is given by dot product of $B$ and $A$.

Note that $A$ is a vector whose magnitude is the area of the element and whose direction is along the normal to the surface of the element and $\theta$ is the angle between the directions of the vectors $B$ and $A$ (Fig. 10.5). In Fig. 10.7(a), the field is directed along the normal to the area, so $\theta$ is zero ( $\cos 0^{\circ}=1$ ) and the flux is maximum, equal to $B A$. When the field is parallel to the plane of the area (Fig. 10.7-b), the angle between the field and normal to area is $90^{\circ}$ i.e., $\theta=90^{\circ}\left(\cos 90^{\circ}=0\right)$, so the flux through the area in this orientation is zero.
[Image removed]

Fig. 10.7

In case of a curved surface placed in a uniform magnetic field, the curved surface is divided into a number of small surface elements, each element being assumed plane and the flux through the whole curved surface is calculated by the sum of the contributions from all the elements of the surface using Eq.(10.5).
From the definition of tesla, the unit of magnetic flux is $\mathrm{N} \mathrm{m} \mathrm{A}^{-}$which is called weber (Wb). According to Eq. 10.5, the magnetic induction $B$ is the flux per unit area of a surface perpendicular to $B$, hence, it is also called as magnetic flux density. Its unit is Wb $\mathrm{m}^{-2}$. Therefore, magnetic induction, i.e. the magnetic field strength is measured in terms of $\mathrm{Wb} \mathrm{m}^{-2}$ or $\mathrm{NA}^{-1} \mathrm{~m}^{-1}$ (tesla).
Example 10.2 A rectangular loop of wire is placed in a uniform magnetic field of magnitude 1.2 T . If the loop is 25 cm long and 20 cm wide, determine the magnetic flux through the loop for the three orientations as shown in Fig. 10.8.

# 10.3 MAGNETIC FLUX LINKAGE 

Magnetic flux linkage is a key concept in electromagnetism, particularly in the study of inductance and electromagnetic induction. Magnetic flux linkage refers to the product of the magnetic flux through a coil and the number of turns in the coil. It essentially measures how much magnetic flux is linked with the coil due to its multiple turns, and is an important factor in understanding how coils and inductors operate in electrical circuits.
Magnetic flux linkage $=\phi=N \phi_{0} \ldots \ldots$ (10.7)
where $\phi_{0}$ is the magnetic flux through a single loop of area $A$ and $N$ is the total number of turns of the coil. Magnetic flux linkage plays a crucial role in the design and operation of transformers, electric motors, generators, and inductors. This concept is particularly important in Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, which we will explore later in this chapter.

### 10.4 MOTION OF A CHARGED PARTICLE IN A MAGNETIC FIELD

We have observed that a current-carrying conductor placed perpendicularly in a uniform magnetic field experiences a force $F$. Since a current is the flow of electric charges, it raises the question: do individual charges moving through a magnetic field also experience a force? The answer is yes. Experiments show that a charged particle does experience a force when it moves across a magnetic field. We can calculate this force by examining the behaviour of a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field.
Consider a conductor of length $L$ through which $N$ charged particles, each with charge $q$, are passing in time $t$. The motion of these charged particles produces a current / in the conductor, which is given by

$$
i=\frac{Q}{t}=\frac{N q}{t}
$$

## Do you know?

Like electric field lines, magnetic field lines also never cross each other. However, they can attract or repel each other.
where $Q$ is the total charge flowing in time $t$. If $v$ is the velocity of charged particles, then the velocity of the particles along the conductor is

$$
\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{v} \mathbf{L}
$$

where $\mathbf{L}$ is the unit vector in the direction of the current. The sign of the force depends on whether the charge $q$ is positive or negative. However, the unit vector $\mathbf{L}$ is directed along the direction of the current, which is the direction of motion of positive charges.
Since the particles take time $t$ to move across the conductor of length $L$, therefore,

# Chapter 10 Deatromegnetism 

## Point to ponder 11

Why does a ploture become distorted when a magnetic bar is brought near to the screen of TV, computer monitor or oscilloscope?

If this conductor is placed in a uniform magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$, it will experience a force $F$, as given by Eq.10.3.

$$
F=I L \times B
$$

As

$$
L=L \dot{L}
$$

Substituting the values of $I$ and $L$ in Eq. (10.3), we have

$$
F=\frac{N q v}{L}(L \dot{L} \times B)
$$

or

$$
F=N q v \dot{L} \times B
$$

As velocity $v$ is directed along the conductor $L$, so we can write: $v \dot{L}=v \dot{v}=v$ (as $\dot{L}=\dot{v}$ )

$$
F=N q(v \times B)
$$

Therefore the force on a single particle will be

$$
F=q(v \times B)
$$

[Image removed]

Fig. 10.10

If 0 is the angle between $B$ and $v$, then magnitude of force $F$ is given by

$$
F=q v B \sin \theta
$$

Therefore, the force is maximum when $B$ is perpendicular to $v$, i.e., $\theta=90^{\circ}$, and force is zero when $B$ is in the direction of $v$, i.e., $\theta=0$. The direction of force can be known by applying Fleming's left hand rule or right hand rule for vector product.
(a) The positively charged particle enters into the magnetic field along the dotted line on plane of paper. It experiences a force in the upward direction due to which it is deflected along a curved path (Fig. 10.10-a).
(b) The negatively charged particle is deflected downward by the force acting on it downwards (Fig. 10.10-b).
Example 10.3 An election enters into a uniform magnetic field perpendicularly with a speed of $10^{4} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. What path the electron will move along inside the field?
$\left(B=2.5 \mathrm{~Wb} \mathrm{~m}^{-2}, \quad m=9.11 \times 10^{-11} \mathrm{~kg}, \quad e=1.6 \times 10^{-16} \mathrm{C}\right)$
Solution The Force $F$ acting on the electron will be:

$$
F=q v B \sin \theta
$$

As the velocity $v$ is perpendicular to $B$, i.e., $\theta=90^{\circ}$, the charge $q=e$, so

$$
F=e v B \times 1=e v B
$$

Since $F$ acts perpendicular to $v$, so this force provides centripetal force to the electron to keep it in a circle of radius $r$. Then

$$
\begin{aligned}
g v B & =\frac{m v^{2}}{r} \\
r & =\frac{m v}{\theta B}
\end{aligned}
$$

Putting the values in above equation, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
& r-\frac{9.11 \times 10^{-21} \mathrm{~kg} \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{1}}{1.6 \times 10^{-18} \mathrm{C} \times 2.5 \mathrm{~Wb} \mathrm{~m}^{-2}} \\
& r=2.3 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}
$$

The path of electron will be a circle of radius $2.3 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~m}$.

# 10.5 VELOCITY SELECTOR 

A velocity selector is a device used to determine the velocity of a charged particle. In this device, electric and magnetic forces are applied to the moving particle in such a way that they balance each other only for one value of velocity, allowing the particle to continue moving with a constant velocity.
Consider a particle with a positive charge $+q$ that enters a uniform magnetic field $B$ at a right angles to it, with a velocity $v$. The magnetic force acts on the particle in the upward direction, as shown in Fig. 10.11. To balance this magnetic force, an electric force must act downward on the particle.
A velocity selector consists of a cylindrical tube located within a magnetic field $B$. Inside the tube is a parallel plate capacitor that creates a uniform electric field $E$. The electric field $\mathbf{E}$ is oriented perpendicular to the magnetic field B, as shown in Fig. 10.12.

Fig. 10.11
[Image removed]

Fig. 10.12

When the charged particle enters the left end of the tube, the magnetic force acts upward, while the electric force acts downward in the direction of the electric field $E$ on the positively charged particle. If the strengths of the electric and magnetic fields are adjusted appropriately, these forces will cancel each other out. With no net force acting on the particle, its velocity $v$ remains constant in accordance with Newton's first law. As a result, the particle moves in a straight line at a constant velocity and exits the right end of the tube.
The particles with velocities different from $v$ will be deflected and will not exit at the right end of the tube.

The magnitude of the velocity selected can be determined as below.
As the velocity $v$ is perpendicular to both $B$ and $E$, therefore,
Magnetic force (upward) $=B q v$
Electric force (downward) $=q E$
For no deflection of particle, $\quad B q v=q E$
or

$$
v=\frac{E}{B}
$$

Example 10.4 Alpha particles ranging in speed from $1000 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ to $2000 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ enter into a velocity selector where the electric intensity is $300 \mathrm{~V} \mathrm{~m}^{-1}$ and the magnetic induction 0.20 T . Which particle will move undeviated through the field?

Solution

$$
E=300 \mathrm{Vm}^{-1}=300 \mathrm{NC}^{-1}, \quad B=0.20 \mathrm{~T}
$$

Only those particles will be able to pass through the plate for which the electric force $q E$ acting on the particles balances the magnetic force $B q v$ on the particles as shown in the Fig. 10.12.
Therefore

$$
q E=B q v
$$

A force is exerted on a moving charged particle in a magnetic field. In what direction it should move that the force is not exerted on it?

Thus, the selected speed is:

$$
v=\frac{E}{B}=\frac{300 \mathrm{NC}^{-1}}{0.20 \mathrm{NA}^{-1} \mathrm{~m}^{-1}}=1500 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}
$$

The alpha particles having a speed of $1500 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ will move undeviated through the field.
Example 10.5 A charged particle moves through a velocity selector at a constant velocity in a straight line. The electric field of the velocity selector is $4.8 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{C}^{-1}$, while the magnetic field is 0.2 T . When the electric filed is turned OFF, the charged particle travels on a circular path of radius 3.0 cm . Find the charge to mass ratio of the particle.

Solution Since the particle is moving in a direction perpendicular to both $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{B}$, so the magnitude of velocity $v$ will be given by

$$
q E=B q v \quad \text { or } \quad v=\frac{E}{B}
$$

When the electric filed is turned off, the particle will move along a circular path of radius $r$. Then the magnetic force provides necessary centripetal force. Then

So, charge to mass ratio becomes:

$$
B q v=\frac{m v^{2}}{r}
$$

$$
\frac{q}{m}=\frac{v}{B r}
$$

Putting the value of $v=\frac{E}{B}$, we have

$$
\frac{q}{m}=\frac{E}{B^{2} r}
$$

Putting the values of $E, B$ and $r$, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{q}{m} & =\frac{4.8 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{C}^{-1}}{(0.20 \mathrm{~T})^{1}\left(3 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~m}\right)} \\
& =\frac{4.8 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{C}^{-1}}{1.2 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~m}}=4 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{C} \mathrm{~kg}^{-1}

# 10.6 INDUCED EMF AND FARADAY'S LAW 

It has been observed experimentally that when a conductor moves across a magnetic field, an electromotive force (emf) is induced between its ends. The induced emf in the moving conductor is similar to that of a battery. That is, if the ends of the conductor are connected by a wire to form a closed circuit, a current will flow through it.

The emf induced by the motion of a conductor across a magnetic field is called motional emf.
Consider an experiment as shown in Fig. 10.13. A conducting rod of length $L$ is placed on two parallel metal rails separated by a distance $L$. A galvanometer is connected between the ends $c$ and $d$ of the rails. This forms a complete conducting loop abode. A uniform magnetic field $B$ is applied directed into the page. Initially, when the rod is stationary, galvanometer indicates no current in the loop. If the rod is pulled to the right
[Image removed]

Fig. 10.13
with constant velocity $v$, the galvanometer indicates a current flowing through the loop. Obviously, the current is induced due to the motion of the conducting rod across the magnetic field. The moving rod is acting as a source of emf $\varepsilon=V_{0}-V_{a}=\Delta V$.
When the rod moves, a charge $q$ within the rod also moves with the same velocity $v$ in the magnetic field $B$ and experiences a force given by, Eq. 10.13.

$$
F=q(v \times B)
$$

The magnitude of the force is:

$$
F=q \vee B \sin 0
$$

Since angle $\theta$ between $v$ and $B$ is $90^{\circ}$, so

$$
F=q \vee B
$$

Applying right hand rule, we see that the force $F$ acting on the charge $q$ is directed from point a to point $b$ along the rod. As a result, charges migrate to the top end of the conductor. As more charges move, a concentration of charge builds up at the top end $b$, while there is a deficiency of charges at the bottom end $a$. This redistribution of charge creates an electrostatic field $E$ directed from $b$ to $a$. The electrostatic force on the charge is $F_{n}=q E$ directed from $b$ to $a$. The system quickly reaches an equilibrium state

where these two forces on the charge are balanced. If $E$ is the electric field intensity in this state, then

$$
q E=q v B
$$

or

$$
E=v B
$$

The motional emf $\varepsilon$ will be equal to the potential difference $\Delta V=V_{0}-V_{0}$ between the two ends of the moving conductor in this equilibrium state. The gradient of potential is given by $\Delta V / L$. As the electric intensity is given by the negative of the gradient, therefore,

$$
E=-\frac{\Delta V}{L}
$$

or

$$
\Delta V=-L E=-(L v B)
$$

The motional emf is:

$$
\varepsilon=\Delta V=L v B
$$

This is the magnitude of motional emf. However, if the angle between $v$ and $B$ is 0 , then

$$
\varepsilon=-v B L \sin \theta
$$

Due to the induced emf, positive charges flow along the path abcds; therefore, the induced current is anticlockwise in the diagram. As the current flows, the quantity of charge at the top decreases, which reduces the electric field intensity, while the magnetic force remains unchanged. This imbalance disturbs the equilibrium in favour of the magnetic force. Consequently, as the charges reach the end ' $a$ ' of the conductor due to the current flow, they are carried back to the top end 'b' by the unbalanced magnetic field, and the current continues to flow.

# Faraday's Law 

The motional emf induced in a rod moving perpendicular to a magnetic field is $\varepsilon=-v B L$. The motional emf as well as other induced emfs can be described in terms of magnetic flux. Consider the experiment shown in Fig. 10.14 again. Let the conducting rod be moving from position 1 to position 2 in a
[Image removed]

# Physica 11 

small interval of time $\Delta t$. The distance travelled by the rod in time $\Delta t$ is $x_{2}-x_{1}=\Delta x$.
Since the rod is moving with constant velocity $v$, therefore,

$$
v=\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}
$$

Putting this value of $v$ in Eq. 10.19, we have

$$
\varepsilon=-v B L=-\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} B L
$$

As the rod moves through the distance $\Delta x$, the increase in the area of loop is given by $\Delta A=\Delta x L$. This increases the flux through the loop by $\Delta \phi_{0}=(\Delta A) B$. Putting $(\Delta x L) B=\Delta \phi_{0}$ in Eq. 10.22, we have

$$
\varepsilon=\frac{\Delta \phi_{0}}{\Delta t}
$$

Eqation(10.20) shows that if the magnetic flux is changing through the single loop of a conducting coil, then the negative of the rate of change of magnetic flux is equal to the emf induced in the loop.
If there is a coil of $N$ loops instead of a single loop, then the induced emf will become $N$ times.
i.e., $\varepsilon=-N \frac{\Delta \phi_{0}}{\Delta t}$
Although the above expression is derived on the basis of motional emf, but it is true in general. This conclusion was first arrived at by Faraday, so this is known as Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction which states that:

The average emf induced in a conducting coil of $N$ loops is equal to the negative of the rate at which the magnetic flux through the coil is changing with time.

The minus sign indicates that the direction of the induced emf is such that it opposes the change in flux.

### 10.7 LENZ'S LAW AND DIRECTION OF INDUCED EMF

In the previous section, a mathematical expression for Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction was derived as:

$$
\varepsilon=-N \frac{\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t}
$$

The minus sign in the expression is very important; it relates to the direction of the induced emf. To determine the direction, we use a principle based on the discovery made by the Russian physicist Heinrich Lenz in 1834. He found that the polarity of an induced emf always produces an induced current that opposes the change in the magnetic field that causes the emf. This principle is known as Lenz's Law, which states that;

The direction of the induced current is always such that it opposes the change that causes the current.
Lenz's Law specifically applies to induced currents and not directly to induced emf. This means we can apply Lenz's Law to closed conducting loops or coils. If the loop is not closed, we can imagine it as if it were closed to determine the direction of the induced current, and from this, we can infer the direction of the induced emf.
Let us apply Lenz's law to a coil in which a current is induced by the movement of a bar magnet. A current-carrying coil generates a magnetic field similar to that of a bar magnet, with one face of the coil acting as the north pole and the other as the south pole. To oppose the motion of the bar magnet, the face of the coil towards the magnet must become a north pole (Fig. 10.15). This arrangement causes the two north poles to repel each other. According to the right-hand rule, the induced current in the coil must flow anticlockwise when viewed from the side of the bar magnet.
[Image removed]

According to Lenz's law, the "push" of the magnet is the "change" that produces the induced current, and the current acts to oppose the push. On the other hand, if we pull the magnet away from the coil, the induced current will oppose the "pull" by creating a south pole on the face of coil towards the bar magnet.
Lenz's law is also a manifestation of the law of conservation of energy and can be conveniently applied to circuits involving induced currents. To understand this, let us revisit the experiment depicted in Fig. 10.16. When the rod moves to the right, an emf is

induced in it, causing an induced current to flow through the loop in anticlockwise direction. Because the current-carrying rod is moving within the magnetic field, it experiences a magnetic force $F_{m}$ with the magnitude of $F_{m}=I L B$ sin $90^{\circ}$.
According to the right-hand rule, the direction of the magnetic force $F_{m}$ is opposite to that of the velocity $v$, so it tends to stop the rod (Fig. 10.16-a). To keep the rod moving with a constant velocity, an extamal force equal in magnitude to $F_{m}$ but opposite in direction must be applied. This external force provides the energy necessary for the induced current to flow. Thus, electromagnetic induction adheres to the law of conservation of energy.
[Image removed]
(a)
[Image removed]
(b)

Fig. 10.16
The Lenz's law forbids the induced current directed clockwise in this case, because the force $\mathbf{F}_{\text {m }}$ would be, then, in the direction of $v$ that would accelerate the rod towards right (Fig. 10.16-b). This in turn would induce a stronger current, the magnetic field due to it also increases and the magnetic force increases further. Thus, the motion of the wire is accelerated more and more. Starting with a minute quantity of energy, we obtain an ever-increasing kinetic energy of motion apparently from nowhere. Consequently, the process becomes self-perpetuating which is against the law of conservation of energy.
Example 10.6 A metal rod of length 25 cm is moving at a speed of $0.5 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ in a direction perpendicular to a 0.25 T magnetic field. Find the emf produced in the rod.

Solution

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Speed of rod } \\
& =v=0.5 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1} \\
& \text { Length of rod } \\
& =L=25 \mathrm{~cm}=0.25 \mathrm{~m} \\
& \text { Magnetic flux density } \\
& =B=0.25 \mathrm{~T}=0.25 \mathrm{NA}^{-1} \mathrm{~m}^{-1} \\
& \text { Induced emf } \\
& =\varepsilon=?
\end{aligned}
$$

Using the relation,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \varepsilon=v B L \\
& \varepsilon=0.5 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1} \times 0.25 \mathrm{NA}^{-1} \mathrm{~m}^{-1} \times 0.25 \mathrm{~m} \\
& \varepsilon=3.13 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{C}^{-1}=3.13 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~V}
\end{aligned}
$$

Example 10.7 A loop of wire is placed in a uniform magnetic field that is perpendicular to the plane of the loop. The strength of the magnetic field is 0.6 T . The area of the loop begins to shrink at a constant rate of $\frac{\Delta A}{\Delta t}=0.8 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. What is the magnitude of emf induced in the loop while it is shrinking?

Solution Rate of change of area $=\frac{\Delta A}{\Delta t}=0.8 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$
Magnetic flux density $=B=0.6 \mathrm{~T}=0.6 \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~A}^{\prime} \mathrm{mi}^{1}$
Number of turns $=N=1$
Induced emf $=\varepsilon=$ ?
Rate of change of flux $=\frac{\Delta \dot{\theta}}{\Delta t}=B \frac{\Delta A}{\Delta t} \cos \theta^{\circ}=B \frac{\Delta A}{\Delta t}$
Applying Faraday's law, magnitude of induced emf is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\varepsilon & =N \frac{\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t}=N B \frac{\Delta A}{\Delta t} \\
& =1 \times 0.6 \mathrm{NAm} \cdot \times 0.8 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~s}^{1} \\
\varepsilon & =0.48 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{C}^{\prime}=0.48 \mathrm{~V}
\end{aligned}
$$

### 10.8 FACTORS AFFECTING EMF

## 1. Rate of Change of Magnetic Flux

Faraday's law suggests that faster changes in magnetic flux result in greater induced emf.

## 2. Number of Turns of the Coil

According to Faraday's law, induced emf is also proportional to the number of turns of the coil. More turns result in a greater induced emf.

## 3. Relative Speed

The speed of the coil (or conductor) through a magnetic field also affects the magnitude of the induced emf. Faster speed increases the rate of change of magnetic flux that results into an increase in the induced emf.

### 10.9 FERROFLUIDS

Ferrofluid is a unique material that exhibits both liquid and magnetic properties. It operates through a combination of magnetic and fluid dynamics principles.
Essentially, the ferrofluid is a colloidal suspension of magnetic particles in a carrier fluid (such as oil or water). Typically, the magnetic particles are iron oxide, ground to the nano-scale and approximately 10 nanometres in size. These particles are coated with a surfactant, a substance that reduces surface tension. This coating prevents the particles from clumping together, ensuring they remain evenly dispersed in the fluid. The

viscosity of the fluid, the nanometre size of the particles, and their constant movement prevent the particles from settling down.
When there is no magnet around, a ferrofluid acts like a liquid, but when there is a magnet nearby, the particles are temporarily magnetized and the fluid becomes a magnet. They form structures within the fluid causing the ferrofluid to act more like a solid. When the magnet is removed, the particles are demagnetized and the ferrofluid acts like a liquid again.

The first ferrofluid developed by NASA in 1960, was ground from natural magnetite. Ferrofluid was invented to move liquids through
specs.

This phenomenon is due to the competition between magnetic forces, surface tension and gravity. In the presence of strong magnetic field, the formation of chain-like structures is a result of magnetic forces pulling the fluid upwards while gravity and surface tension work to pull it back down. These chains align along the magnetic field lines and increase the viscosity, making it behave like a solid bulging in certain directions. These are commonly known as spikes. However, the spikes are formed where the magnetic forces overcome the other forces (Fig.10.17).

Fig. 10.17

The following experiment will exhibit this phenomenon.

# Experiment 

You need some laser printer toner, some cocking oil, a test tube, a glass bottle, a small stick and a magnet.

## Procedure

Pour some toner in the test tube. Remember that laser printer toner contains $40 \%$ iron oxide in nanometre particle size. Add some cooking oil in it and mix it well with the stick to form ferrofluid. Put this fluid in the bottle. The fluid will act like a liquid on shaking the bottle. Now bring the magnet near to fluid outside of the bottle.
You will observe that the fluid jumps towards the magnet, because it has itself become a magnet. If we hold the magnet on the side of the bottle, you will see a structure with spikes formed by the fluid as shown in Fig. 10.18.

# Applications of Ferrofluids 

There are many applications of ferrofluids in the fields of electronics, medicine, engineering, and active research in Physics and Material science. In electronics, ferrofluids are used in rotary seals for computer hard drives and other rotating shaft motors. In loudspeakers, ferrofluids are used to cool the voice coil which can heat up during operation. The magnetic field holds the fluid in place around the coil, allowing it to absorb and dissipate heat more effectively. Ferrofluids are also used in speakers to dampen vibrations and improve sound quality.
In medical applications, ferrofluids can be directed to specific areas in the body using external magnets, allowing for targeted drug delivery. The magnetic particles can carry drugs directly to a tumor or other targeted site, reducing side effects and improving treatment efficiency. Ferrofluids can also be used as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Other applications of ferrofluids include damping or precisely controlling the flow of liquids by manipulating the magnetic field.

### 10.10 A SEISMOMETER

A seismometer is an instrument that responds to any movement of the rocks under the ground or vibration caused by earthquakes, volcano eruption and explosion. A seismometer detects earthquakes by using electromagnetic induction to convert ground motion into electrical signals. Typically, a seismometer includes a weight suspended by a spring. When an earthquake occurs, the ground moves but the weight tends to stay stationary due to inertia. This results in relative motion between the weight and the frame of the seismometer which is attached to the ground. The weight is often attached to a magnet which moves inside a coil of wire (Fig.10.19). This setup works according to Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, that is, the changing magnetic flux through the coil induces an emf in the coil. This gives rise to an induced electric current.

The induced current is proportional to the velocity of the ground motion. The electrical signals generated are then amplified and recorded. Thus, data is provided on the amplitude, frequency and the duration of the earthquake waves.

## For your information

Most earthquakes are caused by plate tectonics (displacement) and occur at a depth of 60 km . These earthquakes are categorized as shallow. Intermediate and deep intermediate can be as deep, as 280 km beneath the crust, while deep earthquakes can reach depths past 280 km .

The data is analyzed to determine various characteristics of the earthquake, such as its location, magnitude and depth.

(It can be thought of as a metaphorical sheet of paper that can bend, and when it bends it can cause effects such as stretching and compression seen when gravitational waves pass through objects.)

At the beginning of the 20th century, new experiments and theoretical calculations revealed that classical physics, based on Newton's laws, could not explain phenomena involving extremely small particles or very high velocities. This led to the development of relativistic mechanics, which offered a more comprehensive framework than classical mechanics and fundamentally changed our view of the universe. Albert Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, introduced in 1905, addressed these issues by proposing that the laws of Physics are the same for all observers and that the speed of light is constant, regardless of the observer's motion. This theory not only resolved the conflicts between classical mechanics and electromagnetic theory but also revolutionized our understanding of time, space, and motion, forming the basis of what is now known as modern physics. This chapter will explore how Einstein's theory reshaped our view of the universe and continues to influence our understanding of the physical world.

### 11.1 RELATIVE MOTION

Consider throwing a ball to your right. For someone facing you, this direction appears to his left. This illustrates that direction is a relative concept. Similarly, the state of rest or motion of an object depends on the observer. For example, the walls of a moving train

# Physics II 

seem stationary to passengers inside the train but appear to be moving to someone standing on the ground. Thus, we cannot definitively say whether an object is absolutely at rest or in motion; all motions are relative to the observer or to the reference frame being used. This becomes evident with the following example: An observer in a closed train compartment uses the compartment as his frame of reference. To determine the train's motion, the observer crops a ball and measures the horizontal distance travelled by the ball, keeping the vertical distance the same in each case. It is assumed that the vertical distance is covered in " $t$ " seconds in all scenarios.
Case (a): Suppose the train is stationary. In that case, the horizontal velocity of the ball will be zero, and the horizontal distance travelled will also be zero. In this scenario, the observations made by the observer inside the train and by someone outside the train will be identical. The ball will have fallen to a point on the floor directly below the point from where it was dropped (Fig. 11.1-a).
[Image removed]

Case (b): The train is moving with a uniform velocity $v_{v}$. When the ball is released, it has an initial horizontal velocity $v_{x}$ and behaves like a projectile. It travels a horizontal distance $v_{x} t$ in time $t$ it takes for the ball to reach the floor. Since both the train and the observer inside it are moving with the same velocity $v_{x}$, they both travel the same horizontal distance $v_{x} t$ in the same time $t$. Therefore, the observer inside the train sees that the ball falls to a point on the floor directly below where it was dropped. In contrast, an observer outside the train will see the ball following a projectile path, as shown in Fig. 11.1(b). Thus, observers in different frames of reference, moving with uniform velocity relative to each other, will perceive motion differently.

### 11.2 FRAMES OF REFERENCE

We have discussed the most commonly used Cartesian Coordinate System. In effect, a frame of reference is any coordinate system relative to which measurements are taken. For example, the position of a table in a room can be described relative to the walls of the room, making the room the frame of reference. Similarly, the laboratory is the reference frame for measurements taken there. If the same experiment is performed in a moving train, the train becomes the frame of reference. The position of a spaceship can be

described relative to the positions of distant stars. A coordinate system based on these stars is then the frame of reference.

# Inertial and Non-inertial Frame of Reference 

An inertial frame of reference is defined as a coordinate system in which the law of inertia is valid. This means a body at rest remains at rest unless acted upon by an unbalanced force that produces acceleration. Other laws of nature also apply in such a system. For instance, a body placed on the Earth remains at rest unless an unbalanced force acts upon it, indicating that the Earth can be considered an inertial frame of reference. A body in a car moving with uniform velocity relative to the Earth also remains at rest, so the car is also an inertial frame of reference. Thus, any frame of reference moving with uniform velocity relative to an inertial frame is also an inertial frame.
However, if the moving car is suddenly stopped or accelerated, the body inside no longer remains at rest. In such cases, the car is not an inertial frame of reference. Therefore, an accelerated frame of reference is a non-inertial frame. While Earth is rotating and revolving, making it strictly speaking a non-inertial frame, it is often treated as an inertial
[Image removed]
frame due to its relatively small acceleration.

### 11.3 SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY

The theory of relativity deals with how observers in different states of relative motion describe physical phenomena. The special theory of relativity addresses problems involving inertial (non-accelerating) frames of reference. There is another theory, called the general theory of relativity, that deals with problems involving frames of reference that are accelerating relative to one another. The special theory of relativity is based on two postulates, which can be stated as follows:
[Image removed]

The speed of light $c$ emitted by the flashlight is measured same by two observers, one moving in the car with speed $v$ and other standing on the road.

1. The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames (Principle of Relativity).
2. The speed of light in free space has the same value for all observers, regardless of the state of motion of the source or the observer (Principle of Constancy of Light).
The first postulate generalizes the fact that all physical laws are the same in frames of reference moving with uniform velocity relative to one another. If the laws of Physics differed for observers in relative motion, those observers could determine which was stationary and which was moving. However, such a distinction does not exist, implying that there is no way to detect absolute uniform motion.
The second postulate states the experimental fact that the speed of light in free space is a universal constant, denoted as $c\left(c=3 \times 10^{4} \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\right)$. Since $c$ is constant, space and time

become relative. For example, if you are sitting in a train moving at the speed of light and you hold up a mirror in front of you at arm's length, you will still see your reflection in the mirror. This is because, according to the principle of relativity, no experiment can detect the constant motion of the train relative to the person inside it.
These simple postulates have far-reaching consequences. They include phenomena such as the slowing down of clocks and the contraction of lengths in moving reference frames as observed by a stationary observer. Some interesting results of the special theory of relativity can be summarized as follows, without going into their mathematical details.

# The Relativity of Simultaneity 

If two events in different locations are observed by one observer to be simultaneous, they will generally not be observed as simultaneous by another observer in a different frame of reference moving relative to the first observer. In other words, whether two events are seen as simultaneous depends on the observer's frame of reference.
Consider a train equipped with light-operated doors. The light switch is located in the centre of the roof and is operated by a traveler standing in the middle of the compartment. When the train is travelling at half the speed of light, the traveler turns on the light. The light travels forward and backward at equal speed and reaches both doors at the same time. Consequently, the traveler sees both doors opening simultaneously. However, an observer outside the train will see the back door open before the front door. This is because the back door is moving towards the light waves, while the front door is moving away from the light waves.

## Time Dilation

If you are in a frame of reference moving at constant velocity from which you cannot see any other frame of reference, there is no way to know if you are moving or at rest.

According to the special theory of relativity, time is not an absolute quantity; it depends on the motion of the frame of reference.
Suppose an observer is stationary in an inertial frame and measures the time interval between two events in this frame. Let this time interval be $t_{0}$. This is known as proper time. If the observer is moving with respect to the frame of events with relativistic velocity $v$, or if the frame of events is moving with respect to the observer with a uniform relativistic velocity $v$, the time measured by the observer will not be $t_{0}$, but rather $t$, given by

$$
t=\frac{t_{0}}{\sqrt{1-v^{2}}}
$$

As the quantity $\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}$ is always less than one, so $t$ is greater than $t_{0}$ i.e., time has dilated or stretched due to the relative motion of the observer and the frame of reference of the events. This astonishing result applies to all timing processes-physical,

chemical, and biological. Even the aging process of the human body is slowed by motion at very high speeds or relativistic speeds.
For example, if a traveler on a plane moving at 0.8 c picks up and opens a book, the event takes one second as measured by the traveler. However, to a person standing outside the plane, the same event takes 1.7 seconds.

# Length Contraction 

The distance from Earth to a stermesstured by an observer in a moving spaceship would appear smaller than the distance measured by an observer on the Earth. In other words, if you are in motion relative to two points that are a fixed distance apart, the distance between the two points appears shorter than if you were at rest relative to them. This effect is known as length contraction. Length contraction occurs only along the direction of motion; no such contraction is observed perpendicular to the direction of motion. The length of an object or the distance between two points measured by an observer who is at rest relative to them is called the proper length $\ell_{0}$. If an object and an observer are in relative motion with speed $v$, then the contracted length $l$ is given by

$$
l-l_{0} \sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}
$$

Let a train that is measured to be 100 metres long when at rest travel at $80 \%$ of the speed of light ( 0.8 c ). A person inside the train will measure its length as 100 metres. However, a person standing by the side of the track will observe the train to be only 60 metres long. This effect of relativity, which is the shortening of length in the direction of motion, is due to length contraction.

## Mass Variation

According to the special theory of relativity, the mass of an object is a variable quantity that depends on the object's speed. An object whose mass is measured at rest is called its rest mass $m_{s}$, will have an increased mass $m$ when observed to be moving at speed $v$. They are related by

$$
m=\frac{m_{s}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}
$$

The increase in mass indicates the increase in inertia that an object has at high speeds. As $v$ approaches $c$, it requires a greater force to change the object's speed.

As

$$
v \rightarrow c, \frac{v}{c} \rightarrow 1, \quad \text { therefore, } \quad \sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}} \rightarrow 0
$$

Thus

$$
m \rightarrow \infty
$$

An infinite mass would require an infinite force to accelerate it. Since infinite forces are not available, an object cannot be accelerated to the speed of light oin free space.
In our everyday life, we deal with speeds that are extremely small compared to the

speed of light. Even Earth's orbital speed is only $30 \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$, while the speed of light in free space is $300,000 \mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This is why Newton's laws are valid in everyday situations. However, when dealing with aubatomic particles moving at velocities approaching the speed of light, relativistic effects become very prominent, and experimental results cannot be explained without considering Einstein's equations.

# 11.4 THE EQUILANCE BETWEEN MASS AND ENERGY 

According to the special theory of relativity, mass and energy are distinct entities but are interconvertible. The total energy $E$ and mass $m$ of an object are related by the expression:

$$
E=m c^{2}
$$

where $m$ depends on the speed of the object. At rest, the energy equivalent of an object's mass $m_{0}$ is called its rest mass energy $E_{0}$. Thus,

$$
E_{0}=m_{0} c^{2}
$$

As $m c^{2}$ is greater than $m_{0} c^{2}$, the difference of energy $\left(m c^{2}-m_{0} c^{2}\right)$ is due to the motion, and it represents the kinetic energy of the mass. Hence,

$$
K_{1} E_{1}=\left(m-m_{0}\right) c^{2}
$$

From Eq. 11.4, the change in mass $m$ due to change in energy $\Delta E$ is given by

$$
\Delta m=\frac{\Delta E}{c^{2}}
$$

Because $c^{2}$ is a very large quantity, this implies that small changes in mass require very large changes in energy. In our everyday world, energy changes are too small to provide measurable mass changes. However, energy and mass changes in nuclear reactions are found to be exactly in accordance with the aforementioned equations.

### 11.5 SPACE-TIME INRELATIVITY

Space is said to be a three-dimensional extent in which all objects and events occur. It provides a framework to define the position and motion of various objects under the influence of some force.
Time measures the sequence and duration of events. In the theory of relativity, time is not absolute; it is considered the fourth dimension. For example, oscillatory motion, such as that of a swinging pendulum, relies on time to determine the frequency of oscillations. Another example is time dilation, a phenomenon discussed earlier in this chapter, where time passes more slowly for an observer moving at extremely high speeds compared to one at rest. The special theory of relativity explains that space and time are related to each other. It describes how space and time are influenced by gravity and speed, such as the bending of light around massive objects like stars.
Space-time is, in fact, a mathematical model that unifies space-time into a single continuum. It is a concept used to describe all points of space and time and their relation to each other. According to Einstein's theory, space-time is curved especially near

# Physice II 

massive bodies and for speeds approaching the speed of light. We can hypothetically visualize this as a fabric sheet. If a heavy ball is placed over this sheet, it curves as shown in Fig. 11.2.
Objects such as stars and planets cause space-time to curve around themselves, much like an elastic fabric deforms when holding a ball. The more massive the object, the deeper the curve.
[Image removed]

Fig. 11.2

Consequently, we do not speak of a force of gravity acting on bodies. Instead, we say that bodies and light rays move along geodesics (analogous to straight lines in plane geometry) in curved space-time. Thus, a body at rest or moving slowly near a massive object would follow a geodesic toward that object.
Einstein's theory provides a physical picture of how gravity works. Newton discovered the inverse square law of gravity but explicitly stated that he offered no explanation for why gravity should follow this law. Einstein's theory also describes gravity as following an inverse square law (except in strong gravitational fields), but it explains why this is so. This is why Einstein's theory is considered an advancement over Newton's, even though it encompasses Newton's theory and yields the same results as Newton's theory in all but very strong gravitational fields.
The bending of starlight caused by the Sun's gravity was measured during a solar eclipse in 1919. The results matched Einstein's theory rather than Newton's, leading to Einstein's theory being hailed as a scientific triumph. Another success of Einstein's theory was the detection of gravitational waves, produced by some celestial events causing disturbances (squeezes and stretches) in the curvature of space-time. These waves were detected in 2015 and announced in 2016.
[Image removed]

Bending of starlight by the Sun. Light from the star A is deflected as it passes close to the Sun on its way to Earth. We see the star in the apparent direction $B$, shifted by the angle $\phi$. Einstein predicted that $\phi=1.745$ seconds of angle which was found to be the same during the solar eclipse of 1919.

Example 11.1 The period of a pendulum is measured to be 3.0 s in the inertial reference frame of the pendulum. What is its period measured by an observer moving at a speed of $0.95 c$ with respect to the pendulum?

Solution

$$
t=3.0 \mathrm{~s}, \quad v=0.95 \mathrm{c}, \quad t=?
$$

Using

$$
\begin{aligned}
& f=\frac{t_{s}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}} \\
& f=\frac{3.0 \mathrm{~s}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{(0.95 c)^{2}}{c^{2}}}}=\frac{3.0 \mathrm{~s}}{\sqrt{1-(0.95)^{2}}}=9.6 \mathrm{~s}
\end{aligned}
$$

Example 11.2 A bar 1.0 m in length and located along $x$-axis moves with a speed of 0.75 c with respect to a stationary observer. What is the length of the bar as measured by the stationary observer?

Solution

$$
t_{1}=1.0 \mathrm{~m}, \quad v=0.75 \mathrm{c}, \quad \ell=\text { ? }
$$

Using

$$
\begin{aligned}
& t=t_{1} \sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}} \\
& t-1.0 \mathrm{~m} \times \sqrt{1-\frac{(0.75 c)^{2}}{c^{2}}}-1.0 \mathrm{~m} \times \sqrt{1-(0.75)^{2}}-0.66 \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}
$$

Example 11.3 Find the mass $m$ of a moving object with speed 0.8 c .

Solution

Using

$$
m=\frac{m_{0}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}
$$

or

$$
m=\frac{m_{0}}{\sqrt{1-(0.8 c)^{2}}}=\frac{m_{0}}{\sqrt{1-(0.8)^{2}}}=1.67 m_{0}
$$

## Intereating Information

If you are on some spaceship moving extremely fast through space near a black hole like in movie, "Intersteller" then you could miss 7 years on the Earth in everyhour.

# Hypothelical Example of Space Time 

Let a spaceship be travelling to a star with half of the speed of light. Let it takes eight years to reach to the star, from the point of view of the observer on the Earth. From the Earth's point of view, the clocks on the spaceship are moving slowly, so that less time passes on the spaceship compared to the Earth.
For the spaceship occupants, the length of the journey has contracted which they cover in less time. The occupants of the spaceship record 7 years to reach their destination, rather than 8 years.

# 12 

We believe that all atoms are made up of neutrons, protons, and electrons. The antiparticles of these three particles are also known. The positron (a positive electron), the neutrino, and the photon are also known. By the end of 1960s, many new types of particles similar to the neutron and the proton were discovered. These were called mesons whose masses were mostly less than nucleon masses but more than the electron mass. Afterwards, other mesons were also found that have masses greater than nucleons. Physicists started to look for more fundamental particles which must have even smaller constituents which was later confirmed by experiments. These were named as quarks. We will discuss in this chapter, the basic building blocks of matter.

### 12.1 STRUCTURE AND PROPERTIES OF THE NUCLEUS

The atomic nucleus comprises two types of particles: protons and neutrons. A proton is the nucleus of the simplest atom, hydrogen, called a protium. The proton has a positive charge of the same magnitude as that of the electron ( $1.6 \times 10^{-18} \mathrm{C}$ ) and its mass is $1.67 \times 10^{-27} \mathrm{~kg}$. The neutron, whose existence was pointed out in 1932 by James Chadwick, is electrically neutral as its name suggested and its mass is nearly the same as that of proton. Now we can say that the nucleus has two types of particles (neutrons and protons) called nucleons.

Besides hydrogen, the nuclei of all other elements consist of both neutrons and protons. The different nuclei are called nuclides. The number of protons in a nucleus is called the atomic number represented by the symbol $Z$. The total number of nucleons, the sum of neutrons and protons, is represented by the symbol $A$ and is called the atomic mass number, or simply mass number. It is written as

$$
A=N \cdot \equiv Z
$$

where $N$ represents the neutron number.
In order to specify the given nuclei, the symbol $X$ is commonly used as ${ }_{X}^{A} X$, where $X$ is the chemical symbol for the element. To indicate the mass of atomic particles, instead of kilogram, unified mass scale (u) is generally used. By definition 1 u is exactly one twelveth the mass of carbon-12 atom ( $1 \mathrm{u}=1.6608 \times 10^{-27} \mathrm{~kg}=931 \mathrm{MeV}$ ). Using this value of $u$, the mass of a proton is 1.007276 u and that of a neutron is 1.008665 u while that of an electron is 0.00055 u .
For a particular atom (e.g., carbon), nuclei are found to contain different numbers of neutrons, although they all have the same number of protons. For example, carbon nuclei always have 6 protons, but they may have different number of neutrons. Nuclei that contain the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. Isotopes of carbon are ${ }_{8}^{12} \mathrm{C},{ }_{6}^{13} \mathrm{C}$, and ${ }_{8}^{14} \mathrm{C}$, amongst them ${ }_{8}^{16} \mathrm{C}$ and ${ }_{8}^{16} \mathrm{C}$ are stable but ${ }_{8}^{14} \mathrm{C}$ is unstable and decays into nitrogen along with the emission of $\beta$ and neutrino

# 12.2 FUNDAMENTAL FORCES OF NATURE 

To understand the structure of the nucleus, it is important to know the nature of the forces that bind the nucleon together. But before that, we should know the basic forces in nature. Despite the apparent complexity within the universe, all interactions in the universe are governed by the four basic forces, known as fundamental forces. These forces control how objects move, interact and behave at different scales from nucleons in the atom to massive galaxies. The four fundamental forces are gravity, electromagnetism, weak nuclear force, and strong nuclear force.
Gravitational force or gravity is one of the four fundamental forces of nature. It is the weakest of the four but it is a long-range force. It is an attractive force and arises due to the gravitational interaction between the bodies. The gravitational force between two bodies is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. When considered for massive objects, such as the Sun, or giant planets, gravitational force is considered to be significant as the masses of these objects are large. However, on an atomic level, this force is considered to be negligibly weak.
The electromagnetic force is responsible for electric field and magnetic field interactions. Like the gravitational force, the electromagnetic force follows an inverse square law but is much stronger than gravity. It governs a vast range of phenomena, from atomic structure, chemical bonding, electricity, magnetism, and light propagation. James Clerk Maxwell (1861) formulated a set of four fundamental equations named as "Maxwell's equations" that unified electricity and magnetism into electromagnetism. These equations describe how electric and magnetic fields interact and how electromagnetic waves propagate. These equations showed that electric and magnetic fields are not separate forces but are two aspects of a single electromagnetic force.
Out of the four fundamental forces, nuclear forces are the strongest attractive forces. Electromagnetism holds the matter together, but there was no explanation on how the nucleus is held together in the atom. If we only consider the forces of electromagnetism and gravity, the nucleus should fly off in different directions. The stability of the nucleus implies that another force should exist within the nucleus which is stronger than the gravitational force and electromagnetic force. This is where nuclear forces come into play. Strong nuclear forces are responsible for holding the nuclei of atoms together. They only exist inside the nucleus. So, we call them as shortrange forces. The strong nuclear force acts as an attractive force between all nucleons. Thus, protons attract each other via the strong nuclear forces at

Table 12.1
Relative strength and range of four fundamental forces

| Force | Approximate Relative Strength (compared to strong force) | Range |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Gravity | $10^{-20}$ | $\infty$ |
| Weak nuclear forces | $10^{-13}$ | $<10^{-18} \mathrm{~m}$ |
| Electromagnetic | $10^{-2}$ | $\infty$ |

the same time they repel each other via the electric force. A neutron, being electrically neutral, can attract other neutrons or protons via the strong nuclear force. Weak nuclear forces are responsible for the radioactive decay, particularly the beta decay and interactions involving neutrino. Unlike the other fundamental forces, the weak force can change the identity of particles, making it essential for processes like nuclear fusion in stars and the decay of unstable atomic nuclei. The relative strength and range of the above four forces are given in Table 12.1.

# 12.3 MATTER AND ANTI-MATTER 

It was predicted by Paul Dirac in 1928 that the fundamental particles have their anti-particles. The rest masses of the anti-particles are the same as that of their corresponding particles but with opposite charges and magnetic moments. For example, positron is the antiparticle of an electron. It is represented by $e^{+}$. The rest mass of the positron is the same as that of an electron but it carries positive charge with magnitude the same as that of an electron. It is noted that the positron was the first discovered anti-particle by Anderson in 1932 in a cloud chamber experiment. This was first experimental discovery of an anti-particle. After that a lot of antiparticles were discovered. Usually, the anti-particles are represented by a letter with a bar over it, e.g., anti-proton is represented by $p$ anti-neutrino by $v$ and so on.
The quarks and leptons have been recognized as the fundamental particles also known as elementary particles among the too many discovered particles These elementary particles have also anti-particles.

2. Linear Accelerators, Cyclotrons and Betatrons are important particle accelerators.

## Interesting information

For their work on this discovery, Dirac and Anderson received the Nobel Prize in Physics-Dirac in 1933, and Anderson in 1936. In 1955, Segre and Chamberlain discovered anti-proton using a particle accelerator and were awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1959 for their discovery of anti-proton.

## Do you know?

(i) The cosmic rays are high-energy particles coming from the outer-space with unknown sources. Their source may be the Sun or the other stars. These particles consist mostly of protons, neutrons and heavier nuclei, which are continually bombarding the Earth. When these particles interact with the atoms of the gases of the Earth's atmosphere, they produce showers of secondary particles which rain down on us all the time.
(ii) When nuclei of unstable radioactive element say ${ }^{101} \mathrm{U}$ undergo fission reactions in the nuclear reactors, they emit a variety of particles, such as; neutrons, neutrinos, $\alpha$-particles, photons, electrons and positrons.
(iii) When the charged particles, such as electrons and protons are accelerated by an accelerator and then bombarded on the target material, which is hydrogen, these accelerated charged particles may also collide head-on with each other. As a result, the debris from these reactions contain particles like pions, kaons, muons and even anti-protons.

# Pair Production 

Pair production occurs when a $\gamma$-ray (high energy photon) passes nearby an atomic nucleus. As a result, an electron-positron pair is emitted as shown in Fig. 12.1. The presence of a third particle, such as a nucleus, is necessary to conserve linear momentum. According to the law of mass-energy equivalence, the minimum energy of a photon for pair production must be equal to the sum of the rest mass energies of the created particles. The rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair is $2 m_{e} c^{2}=1.02 \mathrm{MeV}$ which has been verified experimentally. A gamma ray photon with energy less than 1.02 MeV cannot produce an electron-positron pair whereas a photon with energy greater than 1.02 MeV creates an electron-positron pair and the excess energy goes into the kinetic energies of the particles.
The process of pair production satisfies the laws of conservation of charge, momentum and energy. It can occur for any particle and anti-

particle.

## Annihilation of Matter

It is the opposite process of pair production. For example, when an electron and a positron interact to each other, they annihilate into two gamma ray photons as shown in Fig. 12.2. The reaction can be written as

$$
e^{+} e^{-} \rightarrow \gamma+\gamma
$$

The energy of each gamma ray photon is 0.51 MeV which is equal to the rest mass energy of an electron or a positron, i.e. $E=m_{e} c^{2}$. In an annihilation reaction, energy and momentum are conserved. Besides the electron and positron annihilation, the annihilation reactions of other particles and their anti-particles can also be carried out e.g., proton and anti-proton, lepton and anti-lepton, quark and anti-quark, etc.

# 12.4 RADIOACTIVITY 

It has been observed that the nuclei whose atomic numbers are greater than 82 are found naturally unstable, and these nuclei spontaneously emit radiations. Such nuclei are called radioactive and the emission of radiation is known as natural radioactivity. These radiations are of three types, $\alpha, \beta$ and $\gamma$-radiations. Unstable isotopes can also be produced artificially in the laboratory by nuclear reactions. This occurs when a stable element is bombarded with high-energy particles, such as neutrons, protons, alpha particles, or gamma rays, causing it to become unstable and emit radiation. This is called artificial radioactivity and radioactive isotopes are named radioisotopes or radionuclides.
The $\alpha$-particles, $\beta$-particles and $\gamma$-radiations are traversed differently when passed through the electric field as shown in Fig. 12.4. It is seen that $\alpha$-particles deflect towards the negative terminal of the electric field, showing that they have a positive charge. The $\alpha$-particles are emitted at high speeds, typically a few percent of the speed of light. However, $\alpha$-particles can travel only several centimetres in the air due to their large mass. The $\beta$-particles deflect towards the positive terminal of the electric field, showing
[Image removed]

Fig. 12.4: The three radioactive radiations, namely alpha, beta and gamma rays

they have a negative charge. The deflection of $\beta$-particles is more than the $\alpha$-particles, proving that they are lighter particles than $\alpha$-particles. The $\beta$-particles are fast-moving electrons and move with speeds up to 0.9995 of the speed of light. The $\gamma$-radiations passed through the electric field without deflection, showing that they have no charge. The $\gamma$-radiations are electromagnetic radiations which consist of photons. They move with the speed of light with the highest penetrating power but the lowest ionization power.
The process of emitting $\alpha$-particles, $\beta$-particles and $\gamma$-radiations from the nucleus is called $\alpha$-decay, $\beta$-decay and $\gamma$-decay, respectively, and are discussed below.

# $\alpha$-Decay 

If the nucleus has more protons than the number of neutrons, the electrostatic force of repulsion becomes greater than the strong nuclear force of attraction. In this case, the nucleus becomes unstable and emits alpha particles in radioactive decay. An $\alpha$-particle is equivalent to a helium ( He ) nucleus which consists of two protons and two neutrons. This means the nucleus loses two protons and neutrons in the $\alpha$-decay. Hence, the atomic number $Z$ decreases by 2 while its mass number $A$ decreases by 4. Alpha decay can be written in general as:

$$
{ }_{2}^{4} \mathrm{X} \rightarrow{ }_{2-3}^{4} \mathrm{X}+{ }_{3}^{4} \mathrm{He} \ldots \ldots \text { (12.2) }
$$

Here ${ }_{3}^{4} \mathrm{X}$ is the parent nucleus which decays into the daughter nucleus ${ }_{3-9}^{4} \mathrm{X}$ and ${ }_{2}^{4} \mathrm{He}$ is the alpha particle. In the $\alpha$-decay, it is experimentally observed that the number of nucleons (A) and electric charge are conserved. An example of $\alpha$-decay is given below:
A radium-228 isotope ( ${ }_{56}^{228} \mathrm{Ra}$ ) emits an alpha particle and decays into a daughter nucleus radon-222 ( ${ }_{46}^{222} \mathrm{Rn}$ ).

$$
{ }_{56}^{228} \mathrm{Ra} \rightarrow{ }_{46}^{222} \mathrm{Rn}+{ }_{3}^{4} \mathrm{He} \text {. (12.3) }
$$

[Image removed]

In the above nuclear reaction, the daughter nucleus ( ${ }_{56}^{222} \mathrm{Rn}$ ) is different from the parent nucleus ( ${ }_{56}^{220} \mathrm{Ra}$ ). This transition of one element into another is called the transmutation of the elements. It is experimentally found that the mass of the parent nucleus is greater than the total mass of the daughter nucleus and the mass of the $\alpha$-particle. Thus, the total mass-energy ( $E=m c^{2}$ ) of the decay products is less than the mass-energy of the original nuclide. This difference in mass-energy is called the disintegration energy $Q$, or the Q-value of the decay.

## $\beta$-Decay

There are two types of $\beta$-decay; $\beta$-decay and $\beta$-decay.

## (i) $\beta$-Decay

Some nuclides have neutron-to-proton ratio (N/P) too large and are the source of $\beta$-decay. The $\beta$-particles are not the orbital electrons but they are created within the nucleus at the moment of emission. In this process, a neutron in the nucleus decays into

a proton and an electron, plus another particle called anti-neutrino which is the antiparticle of neutrino. The neutrino is denoted by a Greek symbol $v$ (nu) and anti-neutrino is denoted by a bar over the $\bar{v}$. The decay process is given by the following relation:

$$
{ }_{n}^{+} n \rightarrow{ }_{1}^{1} p+{ }_{n}^{+} e+\bar{v}
$$

One of the neutrons changes to a proton and in order to conserve charge it emits an electron. These electrons are called beta particles. However, they are indistinguishable from orbital electrons. Both the neutrino and the anti-neutrino have zero charge and very small mass, that is why they are very difficult to observe when passing through the matter. No nucleons are lost when a $\beta$-particle is emitted, and the total number of nucleons A remains the same but the mass number $Z$ changes. Beta decay process can be written as:

$$
{ }_{Z}^{A} X \rightarrow{ }_{2+}+{ }_{n}^{+} e+\bar{v}
$$

From the above equation, it is clear that the parent element of atomic number $Z$ is transmuted to another element of atomic number ( $Z+1$ ). An example is the isotope of thorium, which is unstable and decays into protactinium by beta emission. The reaction is represented as:

$$
{ }_{2}^{A} \mathrm{Th} \rightarrow{ }_{91}^{238} \mathrm{~Pa}+{ }_{1}^{+} e+\bar{v}
$$

## For reachormation

The neutrino was first proposed by Wolfgang Pauli in 1930 to obey the energy conservation in the betamirua and beta-plus decays. Later in 1953, neutrino was detected by F. Reines and C. L. Cowan in a high-power nuclear reactor. On this discovery, F. Reines received the Nobel prize in 1995.

# (ii) $\beta^{-}$-Decay 

There are also nuclides that have neutron-to-proton ratio (N/P) too small for stability and decay by emitting a positron instead of an electron. The positron (e+) has the same mass as the electron but it has a positive charge. The positron is the anti-particle of the electron. In this process, a proton in the nucleus decays into a neutron and a positron, plus a neutrino. The generalized decay is given below:

$$
{ }_{Z}^{A} X \rightarrow{ }_{Z+1}^{A} X+{ }_{n}^{+} e+v
$$

An example of a decay of Neon into Flourine by emitting positron and neutrino is:

$$
{ }_{10}^{12} \mathrm{Ne} \rightarrow{ }_{0}^{12} \mathrm{~F}+{ }_{4}^{0} e+v
$$

## Energy of Alpha and Beta Particles in Radioactive Decay

In both $\alpha$-decay and $\beta$-decay, for a particular radionuclide, the same amount of energy is released. In $\alpha$-decay of a particular radionuclide, every emitted $\alpha$-particle has the same sharply defined kinetic energy. When the number of $\alpha$-particles is plotted against kinetic energy, there are distinct spikes that appear on the graph as shown in Fig. 12.5. This demonstrates that $\alpha$-particles have discrete energies.
[Image removed]

Fig. 12.5: Discrete energy values of $\alpha$-particles

However, in the case of $\beta$-particle emission, energy is shared between $\beta$-particle and antineutrino in varying proportions. The sum of electron (or positron) energy and the antineutrino's (or neutrino's) energy, however, in every case remains the same. Thus, in $\beta$-decay, the energy of an electron or a positron may range from zero to a maximum value. When the number of $\beta$-particles is plotted against kinetic energy, the graph shows a curve as shown in Fig. 12.6. This demonstrates that beta particles

Kinetic energy (eV)

(electrons or positrons) have a continuous range of energies. The principle of conservation of momentum and energy applies in both alpha and beta emission.

# (III) $\gamma$-Radiation 

The emission of $\gamma$-radiation from a nucleus is generally represented by this equation:

$$
\Sigma \rightarrow \Sigma X+\gamma
$$

where $\Sigma \vec{X}$ represents an excited nucleus while $\Sigma \vec{X}$ shows ground state of the nucleus.

### 12.5 FUNDAMENTAL PARTICLES

By the term fundamental particle, we mean a particle that has no internal structure, which means that it is indivisible. Presently, the fundamental constituents of matter are considered to be quarks (protons, neutrons and mesons are made up of quarks) and leptons (including electrons, positrons, and neutrinos). They are considered the basic

# phystes 11 

## 12 Nudear and Pettide Physios

building blocks of matter.
When a nucleus is smashed in an ultra high energy particle accelerator, or two high energy particles are collided, entirely new types of particles are created which apparently do not exist within the atoms of the ordinary matter. They are the outcome of the violent collisions needed to probe the basic structure of matter. More than a hundred new particles have been identified to be classified into families with similar properties. Many of these were accounted well with the scheme of theoretical physicist while the rest were named "strange particle". They are always created in pairs, e.g., when a pion ( $\pi$ ) collides with a proton, two strange particles $k^{\circ}$ (Kaon), and $\Lambda^{\circ}$ (Lamda) are created. The nuclear reaction is:

$$
\pi^{\prime}+\mathrm{p} \rightarrow \mathrm{k}^{\circ}+\Lambda^{\circ}
$$

All particles spin on their axes and the spin of charged particles makes them tiny magnets. The characteristic spin of electrons, protons, neutrons is $1 / 2$ and the spin of photon is 1 and of pions is taken as zero. Half spin particles obey the Pauli's exclusion principle which says that only one particle of a kind occupies a given quantum state. These particles are called "fermions". The particles with zero or whole number spin do not obey this principle. They are called "bosons", as they obey Bose-Einstein statistics. Further major classifications are:

1. The nucleons and the heavier particles such as $\Lambda^{\circ}$ and $k^{\circ}$ which decay to nucleons are called "baryons" (heavy).
2. The particles that do not interact strongly with nucleons, and are called leptons (small) along with the electrons, lau and neutrino.
Both of the $\beta$-decay (beta-minus and beta-plus) processes provide evidence that the protons and neutrons are not the fundamental particles. By the 1960s many new types of particles similar to the neutron and proton were discovered, as well as many "midsized" particles called mesons whose masses were mostly less than nucleon masses but more than the electron mass (other mesons, found later, have masses greater than nucleons). The strongly attractive particles are called $\pi$ meson or pions while the weakly interacting particles were named $\mu$ mesons or muons.
This discovery led to the conclusion that these particles could not be fundamental particles, and must be made up of even smaller constituents, which were given the name quarks.

## Hadrons and Leptons

Particles can also be classified based on the four fundamental forces that act on them. While the gravitational force affects all particles. Its impact at the subatomic level is so minimal that it is generally disregarded at the sub-atomic level. The electromagnetic force, which acts on all electrically charged particles, is well understood and can be considered when necessary; however, in this chapter, we will largely ignore its effects.
Particles can be broadly classified based on whether they interact via the strong force or

do not. Those that experience the strong force are known as hadrons, while those that do not, are called leptons. Examples of hadrons include protons, neutrons, and pions, whereas electrons and neutrinos are classified as leptons.
Hadrons are composite subatomic particles that can be further divided into two broad categories: some are bosons, referred to as mesons such as pion, while others are fermions, known as baryons, with protons and neutrons being the key examples. Baryons are made of an odd number of quarks (usually three quarks), and mesons are made up of an even number of quarks (usually two quarks: one quark and one antiquark).
The leptons interact only through weak or electromagnetic interactions. No experiments have yet been able to reveal any internal structure for the leptons; they appear to be truly fundamental particles that cannot be split into smaller particles. All known leptons have spin $1 / 2$, so they all are fermions. The six known leptons are grouped as three pairs of particles as shown in Table 12.3. Each pair includes a charged particle $\left(e, \mu^{\prime}, \tau^{\prime}\right)$, its associated neutrino and corresponding anti-particles. Charged leptons can combine with other particles to form various composite particles such as atoms and positronium, while neutrinos rarely interact with anything, and are consequently rarely observed. The best-known of all leptons is the electron.

# 12.6 QUARKS 

In 1964, M. Gell-Mann and George Zweig proposed that none of the hadrons, not even the proton and neutron, are truly fundamental, but instead are made up of combinations of three more fundamental entities called quarks or quark flavours. Quarks are considered to be truly fundamental particles, like leptons. Three quarks originally proposed were named up, down, and strange, with abbreviations $\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{d}$ and $\mathbf{s}$, respectively. Presently, we are aware of six quarks, just as there are six leptons-based on a presumed symmetry in nature. The other three quarks are called charm, bottom, and top ( $\mathbf{c}, \mathbf{b}, \mathbf{t}$ ). These new quarks can be distinguished from the 3 original quarks (Table 12.4). All quarks have a spin and an electric charge (a fraction of the previously thought smallest charge eon an electron). Quarks are invisible. They never appear on their own.

All hadrons are considered to be made up of combinations of quarks (plus the gluons that hold them together), and their properties are described by looking at their quark content. Mesons consist of a quark-antiquark pair. For example, $a \pi^{\circ}$ meson is a ud combination. $A \pi^{\circ}$ can be made of uü).
Each baryon, on the other hand, consists of three quarks, such as:
The proton has a quark composition of uud and so its charge quantum number is:
$q($ uud $)=\frac{2}{3}+\frac{2}{3}+\left(-\frac{1}{3}\right)=+1$
Neutron has a quark composition of udd and Its charge quantum number is:
$q($ udd $)=\frac{2}{3}+\left(-\frac{1}{3}\right)+(-\frac{1}{3})=0$

| Table 12.4: Quark flavours |  |  |  |  |  |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Particles | Symbol | Charge <br> (q) | Mass <br> (MeV/ $\mathrm{E}^{\prime}$ ) | Antl. <br> Particle | Charge <br> (q) |
| Up | u | $+\frac{2}{3}$ | 5 |  | $-\frac{2}{3}$ |
| Down | d | $-\frac{1}{3}$ | 10 | $\frac{-}{d}$ | $+\frac{1}{3}$ |
| Charm | c | $+\frac{2}{3}$ | 1600 | c | $-\frac{2}{3}$ |
| Strange | s | $-\frac{1}{3}$ | 200 | $\frac{2}{3}$ | $+\frac{1}{3}$ |
| Top | t | $+\frac{2}{3}$ | 175000 | t | $-\frac{2}{3}$ |
| Bottom | b | $-\frac{1}{3}$ | 4300 | b | $+\frac{1}{3}$ |

Mesons are quark-antiquark pairs. Consider the meson $\pi^{\circ}$, which consists of an upquark u and an antidown quark d. We see that the charge quantum number of the up quark is $+2 / 3$ and that of the antidown quark is $+1 / 3$. This edda nicely to a charge quantum number of +1 for the $n^{\circ}$ meson; that is, $q(u)=2 / 3+1 / 3=+1$.

Not long after the quark theory was proposed, it was suggested that quarks have another property (or quality) called colour, or "colour charge" (analogous to electric charge). According to this theory, each flavour of quark can have one of three colours, usually designated red, green, and blue. Note that the names "colour" and "flavour" have nothing to do with our senses, but are purely whimsical-as are other names, such as charm, in this new field. The anti-quarks are coloured antired, antigreen, and antiblue. Baryons are made up of three quarks, one of each colour. Mesons consist of a quark-anti-quark pair

of a particular colour and its anti-colour. Both baryons and mesons are thus colourless or white. Each quark is assumed to carry a colour charge, analogous to an electric charge, and the strong force between quarks is referred to as the colour force. This theory of the strong force is called quantum chromodynamics or QCD, to indicate that the force acts between colour charges (and not between, say, electric charges). The strong force between two hadrons is considered to be a force between the quarks that make them up.

# Beta Decay in Terms of Quarks 

When a neutron in the nucleus decays into a proton and an electron (beta particle), an anti-neutrino is also produced in the reaction and the decay process is given as:

$$
{ }_{n}^{1} n \rightarrow{ }_{1}^{1} p+{ }_{1}^{2} e+\bar{v}
$$

Now, we can identify that a neutron with composition udd can convert into a proton with composition uud by changing a down quark into an up quark. The fundamental decay process can now be expressed as:

$$
d \rightarrow u+{ }_{1}^{2} e+\bar{v}
$$

[Image removed]

Thus, as our understanding of the fundamental nature of matter deepens, we can analyze familiar processes at increasingly intricate levels. The quark model not only enhances our comprehension of particle structures but also provides insight into their interactions.

### 12.7 HIGGS BOSON

Fundamental particles are considered to be the six quarks, the six leptons and the gauge bosons (Higgs bosons), which are the carriers of the fundamental forces. Leptons and quarks interact with each other by sending and receiving bosons. For example, electromagnetic interactions occur when two positively charged particles send and receive (exchange) photons. The photons are said to "carry" the force between charged particles. Likewise, attraction between two quarks in an atomic nucleus occurs when two quarks send and receive gluons. Similarly, the $\mathrm{W}^{\prime}, \mathrm{W}$ and Z are the bosons that are the carriers of weak nuclear force and gravitons are the carriers of gravitational force. The Higgs boson is a special particle discovered in 2012 at large hadron collider at CERN. It is associated with the Higg's field that permeates all of the space. Its crucial role is that it provides explanation for how the other particles get mass by interacting with it.
The particles that interact strongly with Higg's field get more mass such as carriers of electroweak interaction i.e., $\mathrm{W}^{\prime}, \mathrm{W}$ and Z bosons whereas the particles like photons do not interact with Higg's field and hence, their rest mass is considered zero. Higgs boson has a mass of around 125 giga-electron-volts ( $\mathrm{GeV} / \mathrm{c}^{2}$ ) and decays rapidly into other particles. Here are some key facts:

1. The Higgs boson gets its mass from its interactions with its associated Higg's field.
2. It can be a unique portal to find the conditions of universe shortly after the Big Bang and signs of dark matter due to its distinctive characteristics and properties.

# 12.8 CONSERVATION LAWS 

All nuclear processess such as nuclear reactions and nuclear decays obey conservation laws such as:

2. baryon number
3. lepton number

### 12.9 THE ASYMMETRY OF MATTER AND ANTI-MATTER IN THE UNIVERSE

Many observations show that there is the asymmetry between matter and anti-matter. This is the most remarkable features of our universe. A number of hypothesis are existed which show that the universe consists almost entirely of matter rather than anti-matter. e.g., the universe is assumed to be composed up $5 \%$ of ordinary matter (electrons, protons and neutrons), $71 \%$ of hydrogen atoms and $24 \%$ of helium atoms, there are no any contribution of anti-hydrogen or anti-helium atoms in the composition of the universe.
The experimental results explain that the matter and anti-matter asymmetry is indeed due to the violation of conservation of baryon number. i.e., there is imbalance number of baryons and its anti-baryons. Now if the particle-antiparticle symmetry is also violated, then there will be a mechanism for making more quarks than anti-quarks, more leptons than anti-leptons and eventually more matter than anti-matter. Hence, it is concluded that the problem asymmetry of matter and anti-matter is still mystery.

### 12.10 MOST OF THE MATTER IN THE OBSERVABLE UNIVERSE IS PLASMA

Our universe is more vast than our thinking, because we still know about its $5 \%$ part but we still do not know about its remaining $95 \%$ part. For example, our universe consists of about $27 \%$ of unknown matter called dark matter and about $68 \%$ a mysterious antigravity material known as dark energy. By adding $27 \%$ and $68 \%$ we have $95 \%$. It means $95 \%$ universe is out of our thinking, i.e., we know nothing about $95 \%$ of the universe.

On the other hand, the $5 \%$ of the universe that we know about it, is an ordinary

matter, where hydrogen and helium are almost in the plasma state. Therefore, these figures indicate that $95 \%$ of the $5 \%$ of the observable universe is the plasma state, while the remaining $5 \%$ is in the form of matter. Hence, it is concluded that most of the matter in the observable universe is plasma.

# 12.11 THE THEORIES ABOUT THE FORCES BETWEEN THE MASSES OF PARTICLES 

To explain the interactions between the masses of the particles through different mediators, we have the following two theories, the quantum field theory and the string theory.

## 1. The Quantum Field Theory

According to this theory, each particle is represented by a field called quantum field and it is responsible to transmit a force from one particle to another by a mediator. For example, let a positively charged particle produces an electric field in the space around it. This charged particle exerts an attractive force on a nearby negatively charged particle through its field. Moreover, the field can also carry energy and momentum from one particle to another. Where the energy and momentum of all fields are quantized. The quanta that exchange momentum and energy from one type of particle to another in their field are called field particles. Thus, we can say that the interactions between particles are described in terms of the exchange of field particle or quanta which are all bosons. For example, the electromagnetic force is mediated by photons called quanta of the electromagnetic field. Similarly, the strong nuclear force is mediated by field particles called gluons, the electro-weak force is mediated by the field particles called Bosons ( $W^{\prime}$ and $Z$ ) and the gravitational forces is mediated by field particles called gravitons.

## 2. String Theory

String Theory is an advanced concept in theoretical physics proposing that the fundamental particles of the universe, instead of being point-like, are actually tiny, vibrating strings. These strings can be open or closed loops, and their vibrations
[Image removed]

determine the properties of particles, including mass and force. String Theory framework, offering a potential theory of everything, still remains unproved experimentally.

# 12.12 THESTANDARD MODEL 

The standard model is the collection of theories that describe the smallest experimentally observed particles of matter and interaction between energy and matter. Three categories of particles form the standard model are shown in Fig. 12.8. Matter, which makes up only $5 \%$ of the universe is composed of quarks and leptons. The fundamental bosons provide three forces: electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force.

The Higg's boson provides an explanation for how the other particles get mass.

This model is still considered incomplete. Currently, it is unable to explain many important features of the known universe such as: (i) gravity (ii) dark matter ( $27 \%$ of the universe (iii) dark energy ( $68 \%$ of the universe).
