The majority of plastics today wind up in landfills or are, at best, recycled into materials that have a very limited range of applications. To address this problem, chemist Guoliang Liu and colleagues designed a reactor that melts polyethylene and polypropylene-two widely used plastics-into a wax. The wax can then be transformed into a surfactant (a chemical compound usable as a detergent). With this promising new method, plastic waste could be turned into a range of useful cleaning products.
Which choice best states the function of the underlined portion of the text?
A) It clarifies the meaning of a scientific term.
B) It describes an environmental concern.
C) It explains the significance of a scientific discovery.
D) It identifies a result that confused the team.

The following text is from H.D.'s 1916 poem "Mid-Day." In the poem, the speaker is on a path in an outdoor setting.

A slight wind shakes the seed-pods-
my thoughts are spent
as the black seeds.
My thoughts tear me,
I dread their fever.
I am scattered in its whirl.
I am scattered like
the hot shrivelled seeds.
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?
A) It illustrates a change in the natural environment that the speaker implies is responsible for the growing misgivings described in the text.
B) It establishes an example of consistency in the natural landscape that the speaker then contrasts with the unpredictability of human emotions.
C) It presents an observation of an occurrence in the natural world that the speaker then expands on to convey a sense of a turbulent interior state.
D) It evokes the ordinariness of an event in nature to suggest that the critical self-evaluation the speaker engages in is a common pursuit.

In 2023 literary scholar Jeremy Douglass cautioned technology investors and enthusiasts who predict conventional books' ultimate displacement by newer forms of media. Douglass observed that the concept of an "interactive" text is much older than technologists assume, extending back to the first time readers scratched notes into a text's margins. In addition, newer media, such as video games, haven't replaced older forms of entertainment, such as comic books, but rather exist alongside them. Douglass believes that rather than supplanting books, technology is simply making new forms of expression possible.

Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?
A) It challenges the stance of the investors and enthusiasts who are mentioned earlier in the text.
B) It explains the basis for the claim made by the technologists mentioned in the text.
C) It suggests that academics are better suited than investors to see the potential uses of contemporary interactive texts.
D) It provides a historical anecdote about the technological challenges involved in reading the earliest interactive texts.

In 2018, scientists discovered an immense aggregation of Muusoctopus robustus (pearl octopuses) along a hydrothermal vent 3,200 meters beneath the ocean's surface. Water temperatures at this site-named the Octopus Garden-climb as high as $11^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, much warmer than the ambient $1.6^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ typical at this depth. Based on observations made over three years, scientists concluded that temperatures at the site likely confer reproductive benefits and that the site is used exclusively for reproduction-6,000 M. robustus adults, hatchlings, and eggs were observed at the garden, but no juveniles were present.

Which statement about M. robustus and the Octopus Garden is best supported by the text?
A) M. robustus leave the Octopus Garden upon reaching an intermediary stage of development.
B) The M. robustus population at the Octopus Garden remains stable despite variations in water temperature.
C) M. robustus nests in the Octopus Garden contain on average fewer but larger eggs than nests at similar ocean depths.
D) The Octopus Garden provides an ideal feeding ground for M. robustus hatchlings.

The following text is from Thomas Mann's 1924 novel The Magic Mountain, translated by John E. Woods in 1995.

The story of Hans Castorp that we intend to tell here-not for his sake (for the reader will come to know him as a perfectly ordinary, if engaging young man), but for the sake of the story itself, which seems to us to be very much worth telling (although in Hans Castorp's favor it should be noted that it is his story, and that not every story happens to everybody)-is a story that took place long ago, and is, so to speak, covered with the patina of history and must necessarily be told with verbs whose tense is that of the deepest past. (c) 1995 by Alfred A. Knopf, Inc.

What does the text most strongly suggest about the story of Hans Castorp?
A) Though it is true that stories of even the most uninteresting people are themselves interesting because all people are unique, the reason this story is interesting is nonetheless difficult to understand because of the passage of time.
B) Even though it is a story of a person of no particular importance, its age and the manner in which it therefore must be told are both indicators that the story itself is important.
C) Like all stories about the lives of inconsequential people, this story must necessarily be related in a particular way if the reason the story is consequential is to be made evident to the audience.
D) It is a remarkable story that happened to an unremarkable person, though one could plausibly argue that because the story is valuable, some of its value accrues to the person at its center.

A student in a political science course is writing a paper on Aristotle's The Politics, in which Aristotle offers his opinion on political instability and gives advice on how constitutions can be preserved. Aristotle observes that different forms of government can fall in different ways-for example, oligarchies might grant power to military leaders during wartime who refuse to relinquish that power during peacetime-but some methods of preserving order apply across all forms of government. The student claims that in particular Aristotle asserts that in a healthy state obedience to law must be as close to absolute as possible and that even minor infractions should not be ignored.

Which quotation from a philosopher's analysis of The Politics would best support the student's claim?
A) "When constructing his argument regarding the characteristics of a well-functioning government, Aristotle asserts that 'Transgression creeps in unperceived and at last ruins the state,' illustrating this idea with a comparison to frequent small expenditures slowly and almost imperceptibly chipping away at a fortune until it is ultimately depleted."
B) "When Aristotle writes on the necessity of avoiding corruption in government, he proposes that 'every state should be so administered and so regulated by law that its magistrates cannot possibly make money.' In particular, he thinks oligarchies are particularly susceptible to corruption through bribery."
C) "When Aristotle considers the health of constitutions, he states that 'Constitutions are preserved when their destroyers are at a distance, and sometimes also because they are near, for the fear of them makes the government keep in hand the constitution.' He holds that rulers who wish to see constitutions preserved must continually remind the populace of the dangers that would result from a constitutional collapse."
D) "When contrasting different forms of government, Aristotle holds that 'oligarchies may last, not from any inherent stability in such forms of government, but because the rulers are on good terms both with the unenfranchised and with the governing classes.' That is, oligarchic leaders who wish to hold on to power will introduce members of disenfranchised classes into government in a participatory role."

Almost all works of fiction contain references to the progression of time, including the time of day when events in a story take place. In a 2020 study, Allen Kim, Charuta Pethe, and Steven Skiena claim that an observable pattern in such references reflects a shift in human behavior prompted by the spread of electric lighting in the late nineteenth century. The researchers drew this conclusion from an analysis of more than 50,000 novels spanning many centuries and cultures, using software to recognize and tally both specific time references-that is, clock phrases, such as 7 a.m. or 2:30 p.m.-and implied ones, such as mentions of meals typically associated with a particular time of day.
Which finding from the study, if true, would most directly support the researchers' conclusion?
A) Novels published after the year 1800 include the clock phrase 10 a.m. less often than novels published before the year 1800 do.
B) Novels published after 1880 contain significantly more references to activities occurring after 10 p.m. than do novels from earlier periods.
C) Among novels published in the nineteenth century, implied time references become steadily more common than clock phrases as publication dates approach 1900.
D) The time references of noon ( 12 p.m.) and midnight ( 12 a.m.) are used with roughly the same frequency in the novels.

Percentage of ULE Attributed to Population Growth and GDP per Capita Growth in Two World Regions
[Image removed]

Region, by time period
urban population growth
GDP per capita growth

In a study of urban physical expansion, Richa Mahtta et al. conducted a meta-analysis of more than 300 cities worldwide to determine whether urban land expansion (ULE) was more strongly influenced by urban population growth or by growth in gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, a measure of economic activity. Because efficient national government is necessary to provide urban services and infrastructure that attract economic investment, Mahtta et al. propose that absent other factors, the importance of GDP per capita growth to ULE would likely increase relative to the importance of population growth as governments become more efficient. If true, this suggests the possibility that $\qquad$

Which choice most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the statement?
A) national governments of countries in Region 1 experienced declines in efficiency in the period from 2000 to 2014, relative to the period from 1970 to 2000.
B) countries in Region 1 experienced a slower rate of economic growth in the period from 2000 to 2014 than countries in Region 2 did, despite increasing national government efficiency in Region 1.
C) national governments of most countries in Region 2 became more efficient in the period from 2000 to 2014 than they had been in the period from 1970 to 2000, but those of several countries in this region did not.
D) national governments of countries in Region 1 and in Region 2 generally became more efficient in the period from 2000 to 2014 than they had been in the period from 1970 to 2000, but at different rates.

A student is researching the Chinese government's 1992 shift to a market economy that emphasizes trade liberalization. One means of trade liberalization involves expanding from ordinary imports into an emphasis on processing imports, which have two types: processing with assembly (in which a firm obtains raw materials from a foreign trading partner without payment and sells the final goods to that partner, charging for assembly) and processing with inputs (in which a firm expends capital to buy raw materials from a trading partner, processes them into final goods, and sells those goods to whichever trading partner it chooses). The student asserts that while initial efforts at trade liberalization were shaped by Chinese firms' limited capital, this situation resolved during the 2000s.

Which choice best describes data from the graph that support the student's assertion?
A) Processing imports with inputs were greater than both ordinary imports and processing imports with assembly in 2006.
B) From 2000 to 2006, processing imports with inputs rose much more sharply than processing imports with assembly did.
C) From 2000 to 2006, neither processing imports with inputs nor processing imports with assembly were greater than ordinary imports.
D) Processing imports with assembly were greater in 2006 than processing imports with inputs in 2000.

Narwhals are shy whales that live in the remote Arctic Ocean. Some of them have a long tusk, like a unicorn horn, with sensitive nerves. Narwhals are known for this tusk, but many actually don't have one and its purpose is unknown. One group of scientists came up with a possible purpose in 2014. The scientists suggested that the tusk may help narwhals determine when water around them is likely to start freezing and become dangerous for them. Marine biologist Kristin Laidre disagrees with that idea, though. She reasons that if the narwhal's tusk serves such an important purpose, then it's most likely that $\qquad$
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A) some narwhals would seek a new habitat.
B) fewer marine animals would also have tusks.
C) more narwhals would have a tusk.
D) narwhals would become less shy over time.

To address the susceptibility of materials used in components of high-performance machinery, such as aircraft engines, to creep (deformation that is induced by persistent mechanical stress and that often occurs at elevated temperatures), materials researchers have developed silicon carbide ( SiC ) fibers for producing aerospace composites. Testing the thermomechanical properties of several commercially available SiC fibers, Ramakrishna T. Bhatt et al. found that in comparison with two polymer-derived SiC fibers, a nitrogen-treated SiC fiber exhibited a lower minimum creep rate, a measure of the rate at which a stress-exposed material deforms at a constant temperature and uniaxial load. The finding suggests that $\qquad$
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A) unlike the two polymer-derived SiC fibers, the nitrogen-treated SiC fiber can substantially inhibit creep, provided that temperatures and loads are consistent.
B) the two polymer-derived SiC fibers likely hold similar potential for reducing the creep resistance of materials exposed to stress and elevated temperatures, thus prolonging the life span of aerospace machinery.
C) composites based on the two polymer-derived SiC fibers have chemical properties that may improve the mechanical and thermal stability of aerospace equipment to a greater extent than do composites based on the nitrogen-treated SiC fiber.
D) aerospace composites containing the nitrogen-treated SiC fiber may have the ability to withstand mechanical stress for a longer period of time than can aerospace composites containing either of the two polymer-derived SiC fibers.

In the 1950s, scientists didn't know much about the ocean floor. Many scientists at the time believed that the ocean floor was mostly flat. But geologist Marie Tharp and her research partner, Bruce Heezen, proved that this idea was wrong. Using sonar data collected from the Atlantic Ocean, Tharp and Heezen showed that the floor was filled with canyons, mountains, and valleys.

In the early days of television in the 1940s, many people thought that US television programs would rely on the financial support of ad agencies and commercial sponsors, much like radio did. But advertisers hesitated to jump into a new space, particularly at a time when the manufacturing of new television sets was stalled due to the US's involvement in World War II. Broadcasters, like the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), needed to persuade advertisers to support their programming despite not knowing whether there would be a robust television audience to begin with.

Which choice best describes the function of the underlined phrase in the text as a whole?
A) It compares the beginnings of radio programming with the beginnings of television programming in the United States.
B) It identifies a specific reason behind some advertisers' hesitance to support television.
C) It describes how broadcasters attempted to convince advertisers to support television.
D) It explains why a type of television programming was popular at the time.

The Bayeux Tapestry, from eleventh-century France, depicts 75 scenes over 250 feet of fabric. It was likely produced by workers embroidering in sections and then joining the resulting panels together. It's plausible that the workshop that produced the tapestry had never produced one so large, and some researchers claim that a close examination of the joins-the places where the panels are stitched together-suggests that the workers developed and refined their joining process over the course of production. For example, the first join the workers completed exhibits a clear misalignment of the borders of the two panels, whereas the later joins are virtually invisible.

Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?
A) It identifies the people and events depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry.
B) It supports an argument about the workers who produced the Bayeux Tapestry.
C) It compares the Bayeux Tapestry with other tapestries from eleventh-century France.
D) It describes how researchers determined where the Bayeux Tapestry was produced.

Little is known about how plate tectonics-wherein slabs of Earth's crust move over, under, away from, and against one another-began. Some researchers contend that tectonic movements began around 3 billion years ago, often noting that computer models of Earth's mantle temperature at the time indicate that the mantle would have been sufficiently molten to enable the plates to move.

## Text 2

Ultimately, any plausible claim about the inception of tectonic movement must rest on empirical evidence from the geological record. Researcher Wriju Chowdhury and his team analyzed the geochemistry of zircon crystals to gain insight into the chemical composition of the magma from which the crystals formed and, based on the data, compellingly argue that plate tectonics may have been occurring as early as 4.2 billion years ago.
Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to what "some researchers contend" as described in Text 1?
A) By suggesting that the temperature of Earth's mantle 3 billion years ago was likely insufficient to allow for the level of tectonic movement predicted by computer models
B) By distinguishing between computer models of Earth's mantle temperature that reliably predict the onset of plate tectonics and those that do not
C) By indicating that computer models of Earth's mantle temperature are still being improved such that new models tend to be much more reliable than their predecessors
D) By asserting that a more definitive form of evidence than the computer models suggests a different timeline for the onset of plate tectonics on Earth

Hevea brasiliensis, a tree in the Amazon rainforest, is the world's main source of natural rubber. The tree produces a milky substance called latex that is used to make rubber. The bark of Hevea brasiliensis is helpful for the process of making rubber because it has a unique structure that makes it easy to collect latex. A network of tubes in the tree's inner bark helps the latex to flow out easily when people make small cuts into the bark.

What feature of Hevea brasiliensis does the text say is helpful for the process of making rubber?
A) Its latex produces rubber of an especially high quality.
B) Its bark has a unique structure that makes it easy to collect latex.
C) It is able to grow in a wide variety of climates around the world.
D) It is one of only two trees in the Amazon that produce latex.

Conservationists worldwide are working to protect ecosystems from habitat destruction and biodiversity loss, and in many cases, initiatives that rely on natural features or processes can help address such challenges. In response to a rapidly dwindling population of blueback salmon, the Quinault Indian Nation (a tribe in Washington State) partnered with the conservation organization Wild Salmon Center to restore naturally occurring logjams in the Quinault River. The logjams create shady pools where the blueback salmon can rest and spawn, thus promoting blueback population recovery.

Which choice best states the main idea of the text?
A) A partnership between the Quinault Indian Nation and Wild Salmon Center shows the importance of collaborative approaches to preserving biodiversity.
B) Nature-based approaches can be effective ways to achieve conservation goals.
C) As indicated by a recent project, logjams help the blueback salmon thrive and reproduce.
D) Scientists now realize that nature-based conservation methods offer better long-term solutions to environmental issues than methods that are not nature-based do.

B) "The first part of planning a new sculpture is done using paper and pencil, and then a digital program is used to finalize the design."
C) "The materials that Echelman uses to build her sculptures are both flexible and strong."
D) "Each sculpture is designed to reflect local landmarks from the area in which it is eventually installed."

Early Earth is thought to have been characterized by a stagnant lid tectonic regime, in which the upper lithosphere (the outer rocky layer) was essentially immobile and there was no interaction between the lithosphere and the underlying mantle. Researchers investigated the timing of the transition from a stagnant lid regime to a tectonic plate regime, in which the lithosphere is fractured into dynamic plates that in turn allow lithospheric and mantle material to mix. Examining chemical data from lithospheric and mantle-derived rocks ranging from 285 million to 3.8 billion years old, the researchers dated the transition to 3.2 billion years ago.

Which finding, if true, would most directly support the researchers' conclusion?
A) Among rocks known to be older than 3.2 billion years, significantly more are mantle derived than lithospheric, but the opposite is true for the rocks younger than 3.2 billion years.
B) Mantle-derived rocks older than 3.2 billion years show significantly more compositional diversity than lithospheric rocks older than 3.2 billion years do.
C) There is a positive correlation between the age of lithospheric rocks and their chemical similarity to mantle-derived rocks, and that correlation increases significantly in strength at around 3.2 billion years old.
D) Mantle-derived rocks younger than 3.2 billion years contain some material that is not found in older mantle-derived rocks but is found in older and contemporaneous lithospheric rocks.

The Uto-Aztecan language family is divided into a northern branch, which includes the Shoshone language of present-day Idaho and Utah, and a southern one, whose best-known representative is Nahuatl, the language of the Aztec Empire in Mexico. Lexical similarities across the family, including of botanical terms, confirm descent from a single language spoken millennia ago, and the family's geographical distribution suggests an origin in what is now the US Southwest. However, vocabulary pertaining to maize isn't shared between northern and southern branches, despite the crop's universal cultivation among Uto-Aztecan tribes. Given archaeological evidence that maize originated in Mexico and diffused northward into what became the US Southwest, some linguists reason that $\qquad$
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A) northern Uto-Aztecan tribes likely obtained the crop directly from a southern Uto-Aztecan tribe rather than from a non-Uto-Aztecan tribe.
B) variation in maize-related vocabulary within each branch of the Uto-Aztecan family likely reflects regionally specific methods for cultivating the crop.
C) southern Uto-Aztecan tribes likely acquired maize at roughly the same time as northern Uto-Aztecan tribes did, though from different sources.
D) the family's division into northern and southern branches likely preceded the acquisition of the crop by the Uto-Aztecan tribes.

Data collected by the Mars rover Curiosity at the Gale Crater's Murray Formation are suggestive of hydrological deposition of sediment in the distant past. To characterize the nature of the depositional environment, Frances Rivera-Hernández et al. analyzed the grain size of Murray Formation sediment, finding that although there are intervals of coarse grains, most of the sediment consists of fine grains that show signs of cracking due to episodic desiccation. Rivera-Hernández et al. concluded that the coarse grains are sandstone, which tends to be deposited by flowing water, whereas the fine grains are mudstone, which is slowly deposited by settling out of suspension in low-flow water, leading the researchers to posit that $\qquad$
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A) although the area of the Murray Formation experienced a prolonged period of dryness that prevented a lake from forming, water flowing from a distant source was present.
B) a lake existed at the Murray Formation for a prolonged period, though the lake occasionally experienced drying and there were periods in which one or more streams were present.
C) one or more streams existed at the Murray Formation for an extended period until being replaced by a lake that persisted for only a brief period before permanently drying.
D) a stream-fed lake was present at the Murray Formation for an extended period, and although the streams experienced occasional drying, the lake did not.

An analysis by Alain Elayi and colleagues of coins minted in Sidon in the fifth and fourth centuries BCE reveals a change in their composition over time: while a coin from circa 450 BCE contains about $98 \%$ silver and $1 \%$ copper, a coin from 367 BCE (the end of Ba'alšillem II's reign) contains $74.2 \%$ silver and $24.7 \%$ copper, giving it a relatively yellowish appearance that traders would have noticed. Because coins with a silver content below $80 \%$ were widely considered unsuitable for trade, Elayi et al. speculate that a crisis in confidence in the currency occurred in Sidon around 367 BCE, which was likely relieveddespite Sidon's persistent oppressive financial obligations-as a result of Ba'alšillem II's successor Abd'aštart I's decision to $\qquad$
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A) proclaim that the percentage of silver in coins suitable for trade would be raised to a threshold higher than $80 \%$.
B) keep the amount of silver in Sidonian coins consistent with that in coins minted in 367 BCE but decrease their weight.
C) begin minting heavier coins with a proportion of silver to copper similar to that in coins minted in 367 BCE.
D) fund the mining of some copper deposits that were not available to Ba'alšillem II.
