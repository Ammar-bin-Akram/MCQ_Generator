The following text is adapted from James Baldwin's 1956 novel Giovanni's Room. The narrator is riding in a taxi down a street lined with food vendors and shoppers in Paris, France.

The multitude of Paris seems to be dressed in blue every day but Sunday, when, for the most part, they put on an unbelievably festive black. Here they were now, in blue, disputing, every inch, our passage, with their wagons, handtrucks, their bursting baskets carried at an angle steeply self-confident on the back.

On painter William H. Johnson's return to the United States in 1938 after a decade in Europe, his style underwent an abrupt transformation. Turning away from landscapes painted in an expressionist style-a style that often involves using fluid, distorted shapes and thick, textured brushstrokes to express the artist's subjective experience of reality-Johnson began painting portraits of Black Americans in a bold new way. Evocative of African sculpture and American and Scandinavian folk art, these portraits feature flat, deliberately oversimplified figures in a vibrant but limited color palette.

Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?
A) It elaborates on the previous sentence's statement about a transitional moment in Johnson's artistic career.
B) It provides information about Johnson's travels in support of a claim about his artistic influences, which is advanced in the following sentence.
C) It recounts a moment in Johnson's personal life that enabled the success of his subsequent career, which is summarized in the following sentence.
D) It presents evidence that calls into question the previous sentence's characterization of Johnson's artistic development.

When classical pianist Martha Argerich performs, it appears as if the music is coming to her spontaneously. She's highly skilled technically, but because of how freely she plays and her willingness to take risks, she seems relaxed and natural. Her apparent ease, however, is due to a tremendous amount of preparation. Despite Argerich's experience and virtuosity, she never takes for granted that she knows a piece of music. Instead, she approaches the music as if encountering it for the first time and tries to understand it anew.

Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?
A) To provide details about how Argerich identifies which pieces of music she will perform
B) To assert that Argerich's performances look effortless because of how she prepares for them
C) To discuss the kinds of music Argerich feels most comfortable encountering for the first time
D) To describe the unique way that Argerich approaches music she hasn't performed before

The following text is adapted from Herman Melville's 1855 novel Israel Potter. Israel is a young man wandering through New England during the late eighteenth century.

He hired himself out for three months; at the end of that time to receive for his wages two hundred acres of land lying in New Hampshire. [...] His employer proving false to the contract in the matter of the land, and there being no law in the country to force him to fulfil it, Israel-who, however brave-hearted, and even much of a dare-devil upon a pinch, seems nevertheless to have evinced, throughout many parts of his career, a singular patience and mildness-was obliged to look round for other means of livelihood than clearing out a farm for himself in the wilderness.
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?
A) It implies that Israel treasures a particular characteristic of his personality when that characteristic should usually be regarded as a flaw.
B) It suggests that if not for a certain aspect of his character, Israel might not have been as easily thwarted in his ambition to establish a farm.
C) It shows why Israel would not have been able to undertake the enormous amount of labor necessary to run a farm even if he had owned the necessary property.
D) It explains why, when the situation requires it, Israel is able to undertake courageous acts that others would generally avoid.

## Text 1

In 1954 George Balanchine choreographed a production of The Nutcracker, a ballet by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. It has since become a tradition for hundreds of dance companies in North America to stage The Nutcracker each year. But the show is stuck in the past, with an old-fashioned story and references, so it should no longer be produced. Ballet needs to create new traditions if it wants to stay relevant to contemporary audiences.

## Text 2

The Nutcracker is outdated, but it should be kept because it's a holiday favorite and provides substantial income for some dance companies. Although it can be behind the times, there are creative ways to update the show. For example, Debbie Allen successfully modernized the story. Her show Hot Chocolate Nutcracker combines ballet, tap, hip-hop, and other styles, and it has been gaining in popularity since it opened in 2009.
Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1?
A) By questioning the idea that the story of The Nutcracker is stuck in the past and by rejecting the suggestion that contemporary audiences would enjoy an updated version
B) By agreeing that contemporary audiences have largely stopped going to see performances of The Nutcracker because it's so old-fashioned
C) By pointing out that most dance companies could increase their incomes by offering modernized versions of The Nutcracker
D) By suggesting that dance companies should consider offering revised versions of The Nutcracker instead of completely rejecting the show

To understand how Paleolithic artists navigated dark caves, archaeologist $\mathrm{M}^{\mathrm{a}}$ Ángeles Medina-Alcaide and her team tested different lighting methods in a cave in Spain using replicas of artifacts found in European caves with art. They used three different Paleolithic light sources-torches, animal-fat lamps, and fireplaces-determining that each likely had a specific purpose. For instance, the team learned that the animal-fat lamps were less useful than torches while walking because the lamps didn't illuminate the cave floor.

Which choice best states the main idea of the text?
A) Medina-Alcaide and her team's study demonstrated that fireplaces were essential to the creators of Paleolithic cave art.
B) Medina-Alcaide and her team discovered that Paleolithic cave artists in Spain used animal-fat lamps more often than they used torches.
C) Medina-Alcaide and her team were reluctant to draw many conclusions from their study because of the difficulty they had replicating light sources based on known artifacts.
D) Medina-Alcaide and her team tested Paleolithic light sources and learned some details about how Paleolithic artists traveled within dark caves.

External shopping cues are a type of marketing that uses obvious messaging-a display featuring a new product, for example, or a "buy one, get one free" offer-to entice consumers to make spontaneous purchases. In a study, data scientist Sam K. Hui and colleagues found that this effect can also be achieved with a less obvious cue: rearranging a store's layout. The researchers explain that trying to find items in new locations causes shoppers to move through more of the store, exposing them to more products and increasing the likelihood that they'll buy an item they hadn't planned on purchasing.

Which response from a survey given to shoppers who made a purchase at a retail store best supports the researchers' explanation?
A) "I needed to buy some cleaning supplies, but they weren't in their regular place. While I was looking for them, I saw this interesting notebook and decided to buy it, too."
B) "I didn't buy everything on my shopping list today. I couldn't find a couple of the items in the store, even though I looked all over for them."
C) "The store sent me a coupon for a new brand of soup, so I came here to find out what kinds of soup that brand offers. I decided to buy a few cans because I had the coupon."
D) "This store is larger than one that's closer to where I live, and it carries more products. I came here to buy some things that the other store doesn't always have."

The 2021 exhibition This Is the Day at Arkansas's Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art featured works dealing with expressions of faith and spirituality in the Black community. The museum's 2022 exhibition The Dirty South, meanwhile, focused on Black culture in the American South from 1920 to 2020, with a particular focus on the intersections between visual arts and music. Together, these exhibitions don't merely highlight the diversity of the Black experience in the US; they also showcase the diverse media through which artists have depicted and engaged with that experience.
Which statement about the exhibitions, if true, would most directly support the underlined claim?
A) Between them, This Is the Day and The Dirty South included drawings, paintings, photographs, sculptures, textiles, videos, costumes, and music.
B) This Is the Day included works by fewer than two dozen artists, whereas The Dirty South included works by more than 80 artists.
C) This Is the Day exclusively included works in the permanent collection of the museum, whereas The Dirty South included works from multiple sources outside the museum.
D) Between them, This Is the Day and The Dirty South included works depicting more than 300 years of Black experience in the United States.

To investigate potential cognitive benefits of taking leave from work, psychologist Jan Packer and colleagues conducted a six-month study of Australian university staff members who took no leave from work during the study, took 2-4 days of leave, or took 1-5 weeks of leave. Tests of attentiveness were administered to participants three times during the study: at random for the no-leave staff, and for the rest, one week before their leave, one week following their return to work, and one week after the second test administration. After analyzing the results, the researchers concluded that longer leave times might not confer a greater cognitive benefit than shorter leave times do.

Which choice best describes data from the graph that support the researchers' conclusion?
A) In the second test administration, participants who took 2-4 days of leave had higher average attentiveness scores than did those who took no leave, but in the third test administration, those who took no leave had higher average scores than those who took 1-5 weeks of leave.
B) In the first test administration, participants who took 2-4 days of leave had lower average attentiveness scores than did those who took 1-5 weeks of leave and those who took no leave.
C) In both the second and third test administrations, participants who took 2-4 days of leave had higher average attentiveness scores than did participants who took 1-5 weeks of leave.
D) In the second and third test administrations, participants who took 2-4 days of leave had higher average attentiveness scores than did those who took no leave.

It may seem that the optimal strategy for an animal pursuing prey or escaping predators is to move at maximal speed, but the energy expense of exploiting full speed capacity can disfavor such a strategy even in escape contexts, as evidenced by the fact that

Which choice most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the text?
A) most lizard species use about the same percentage of their maximal speed when escaping predation as they do when pursuing prey.
B) multiple lizard species move at an average of less than $90 \%$ of their maximal speed while escaping predation.
C) more lizard species use, on average, $90 \%-100 \%$ of their maximal speed while escaping predation than use any other percentage of their maximal speed.
D) at least 4 lizard species use, on average, less than $100 \%$ of their maximal speed while pursuing prey.

Under normal atmospheric pressure at Earth's surface, water molecules form a tetrahedral network stabilized by hydrogen bonds between adjacent molecules. Extreme high pressure, such as can be found in deep ocean waters, destabilizes these bonds and compresses water's structure, allowing water molecules within organisms to permeate proteins and impede crucial biological functions; yet deep-sea organisms known as piezophiles have adapted to extreme pressure. Studies have found a positive correlation between the depths that various piezophiles inhabit and concentrations of a compound called trimethylamine N -oxide (TMAO) in their muscle tissues, which has led a team of researchers to hypothesize that TMAO reduces water's compressibility.
Which finding, if true, would most directly support the researchers' hypothesis?
A) Water molecules are found to be impervious to TMAO even when the water molecules' tetrahedral configuration has been distorted by high pressure.
B) Examination of TMAO's molecular structure shows that TMAO molecules retain their shape even as pressure increases.
C) A positive correlation is found between concentrations of TMAO and the rate at which water's molecular structure compresses as pressure increases.
D) Analysis of water's molecular structure under high pressure reveals that hydrogen bonds are more stable when TMAO is present than when it is not.

The Cretaceous pterosaur Tupandactylus navigans is known for having an anomalously oversized head crest. Until an almost complete fossil skeleton was found in Brazil, paleontologists had been able to study only skull specimens from T. navigans, though it was presumed that, like other pterosaurs, the species's primary form of locomotion was powered flight. Examining the fuller skeleton in 2016, Victor Beccari and his team determined that T. navigans had long hind legs, short wings, and an unusually long neck-characteristics that, combined with the creature's large-crested head, would have made sustained flight difficult and walking upright relatively comfortable. Based on these findings the team suggests that T. navigans likely $\qquad$
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A) flew for longer distances than did other pterosaur species that had oversized head crests.
B) had longer wings than other pterosaur species considered to have been comfortable walking.
C) had a smaller head than researchers expected based on the earlier T. navigans skull specimens.
D) flew for shorter distances and spent more time walking than researchers previously thought.

Consumer psychologists have theorized that the likelihood that people who identify as ethical consumers-meaning that they strive to purchase goods and services with positive or neutral social and ecological effects-will purchase a given product positively correlates with their perception of that product's effects. In a recent study of the attitudes of self-identified ethical consumers toward purchasing a specific mobile phone coming to market, researchers found that, on average, study participants in their twenties rated the phone's social and ecological effects much less positively than did participants in other age groups. All other things being equal, if consumer psychologists' theory is correct, this finding suggests that $\qquad$

Researchers have long hypothesized that woolly mammoths were hunted to extinction in North America by humans using spears with grooved tips known as Clovis points. One anthropologist set out to test this hypothesis. Using a mechanical spear-thrower, he launched spears with Clovis points into mounds of clay-substitutes for the animals' large bodies. The projectiles generally penetrated only a few inches into the clay, an amount insufficient to have harmed most woolly mammoths. This led the anthropologist to conclude that hunters using spears with Clovis points likely weren't the principal drivers of the extinction.

Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?
A) To argue for the significance of new findings amid an ongoing debate among researchers
B) To discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the method used in an experiment
C) To summarize two competing hypotheses and a major finding associated with each one
D) To describe an experiment whose results cast doubt on an established hypothesis

The people of medieval Europe have traditionally been seen as uninterested in cleanliness and hygiene, but modern research has shown that this is largely a myth. According to historian Eleanor Janega, most medieval towns in Europe had at least one public bathhouse, which often offered both full-immersion baths and-more affordably-steam baths. While such amenities were available mainly to town dwellers, regular bathing in rivers and streams or daily sponge baths at home were common practices throughout medieval Europe.

Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion?
A) It asserts that in medieval Europe steam baths were more popular in rural areas than in urban ones.
B) It describes a limitation of earlier historians' studies of medieval European bathing habits.
C) It concedes that not all people in medieval Europe had access to public bathhouses.
D) It explains why Janega decided to study the popularity of public bathhouses in medieval Europe.

Scholarly accounts of the Chicano movement-a movement that advocated for the social, political, and cultural empowerment of Mexican Americans and reached its zenith in the 1960s and 1970s-tend to focus on the most militant, outspoken figures in the movement, making it seem uniformly radical. Geographer Juan Herrera has shown, however, that if we shift our focus toward the way the movement manifested in comparatively low-profile neighborhood institutions and projects, we see participants espousing an array of political orientations and approaches to community activism.

Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?
A) It presents a trend in scholarship on the Chicano movement that the text claims has been reevaluated by researchers in light of Herrera's work on the movement's participants.
B) It identifies an aspect of the Chicano movement that the text implies was overemphasized by scholars due to their own political orientations.
C) It describes a common approach to studying the Chicano movement that, according to the text, obscures the ideological diversity of the movement's participants.
D) It summarizes the conventional method for analyzing the Chicano movement, which the text suggests creates a misleading impression of the effectiveness of neighborhood institutions and projects.

Elizabeth Asiedu has identified a negative correlation between the share of developing countries' economies derived from natural-resource extraction and those countries' receipts of foreign investment. This may appear counterintuitive-resource extraction requires initial investments (in extractive technology, for instance) at scales best met by multinational corporations-but Asiedu notes that natural-resource industries' boom-bust cycle can destabilize local currencies and increase developing countries' vulnerability to external shocks, creating levels of uncertainty to which foreign investors are typically averse.

A) Although it may seem surprising that foreign investment declines in developing countries as natural-resource extraction makes up a larger share of those countries' economies, that decline happens because resource extraction requires initial investments too large for foreign investors to supply.
B) Although developing countries tend to become less dependent on foreign investment as natural-resource industries make up a larger share of their economies, this change may not occur if the boom-bust cycle of those industries destabilizes local currencies or increases countries' vulnerability to external shocks.
C) Although one might expect that foreign investment would increase as natural-resource extraction makes up a larger share of developing countries' economies, the opposite happens because heavy reliance on natural resources can lead to unattractive conditions for investors.
D) Although foreign investors tend to avoid initial investments in natural-resource industries in developing countries, foreign investment may increase significantly as those industries stabilize and the risks associated with them decline.

To understand how temperature change affects microorganism-mediated cycling of soil nutrients in alpine ecosystems, Eva Kaštovská et al. collected plant-soil cores in the Tatra Mountains at elevations around 2,100 meters and transplanted them to elevations of $1,700-1,800$ meters, where the mean air temperature was warmer by $2^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Microorganismmediated nutrient cycling was accelerated in the transplanted cores; crucially, microorganism community composition was unchanged, allowing Kaštovská et al. to attribute the acceleration to temperature-induced increases in microorganism activity.

It can most reasonably be inferred from the text that the finding about the microorganism community composition was important for which reason?
A) It provided preliminary evidence that microorganism-mediated nutrient cycling was accelerated in the transplanted cores.
B) It suggested that temperature-induced changes in microorganism activity may be occurring at increasingly high elevations.
C) It ruled out a potential alternative explanation for the acceleration in microorganism-mediated nutrient cycling.
D) It clarified that microorganism activity levels in the plant-soil cores varied depending on which microorganisms comprised the community.

Some astronomers searching for extraterrestrial life have proposed that atmospheric $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ (ammonia) can serve as a biosignature gas-an indication that a planet harbors life. Jingcheng Huang, Sara Seager, and colleagues evaluated this possibility, finding that on rocky planets, atmospheric $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ likely couldn't reach detectably high levels in the absence of biological activity. But the team also found that on so-called mini-Neptunes-gas planets smaller than Neptune but with atmospheres similar to Neptune's-atmospheric pressure and temperature can be high enough to produce atmospheric $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$.

Based on the text, Huang, Seager, and colleagues would most likely agree with which statement about atmospheric $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ ?
A) Its presence is more likely to indicate that a planet is a mini-Neptune than that the planet is a rocky planet that could support life.
B) Its absence from a planet that's not a mini-Neptune indicates that the planet probably doesn't have life.
C) It should be treated as a biosignature gas if detected in the atmosphere of a rocky planet but not if detected in the atmosphere of a mini-Neptune.
D) It doesn't reliably reach high enough concentrations in the atmospheres of rocky planets or mini-Neptunes to be treated as a biosignature gas.

To test whether a medication is effective, scientists compare outcomes for patients taking it and patients taking a placebo (a medically inactive substance). Patients normally aren't told they're receiving a placebo, but a research team conducted a study to see if there might be a medical benefit to telling them. The team used various measures to evaluate participants, with higher ratings indicating greater well-being in each measure. Compared to the mean ratings after 21 days for participants in the control group, the mean ratings for participants who were aware of taking a placebo $\qquad$
Which choice most effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement?
A) ranged from 5.0 to 92.00 , indicating that well-being varied widely from participant to participant.
B) were lower for two measures, with the rating for only one measure indicating greater well-being for these participants.
C) ranged from 3.9 to 46.00 , with no rating indicating greater well-being in any measure for these participants.
D) were higher for all three measures, indicating greater overall well-being for these participants.

As media consumption has become increasingly multiplatform and socially mediated, active news acquisition has diminished in favor of an attitude known as "news finds me" (NFM), in which people passively rely on their social networks and ambient media environments for information about current events. Homero Gil de Zúñiga and Trevor Diehl examined data on a representative group of adults in the United States to determine participants' strength of NFM attitude, political knowledge, and political interest. Although no major election took place sufficiently near the study for Gil de Zúñiga and Diehl to identify causality between NFM and voting behavior, they did posit that NFM may reduce voting probability through an indirect effect.
Which finding, if true, would most directly support the idea advanced by Gil de Zúñiga and Diehl?
A) NFM attitude tends to increase in strength as major elections approach, and people are significantly more likely to vote in major elections than in minor elections.
B) NFM attitude has a strong negative effect on political knowledge and interest, and there is known to be a strong positive correlation between political knowledge and interest and the likelihood of voting.
C) Political interest is known to have a strong positive effect on likelihood of voting but shows only a weak positive effect on political knowledge, and NFM attitude shows little correlation with either political knowledge or political interest.
D) The likelihood of voting increases as political knowledge increases, and the relationship between NFM attitude and political knowledge tends to strengthen as the size of people's social networks increases.

The practice of logging (cutting down trees for commercial and other uses) is often thought to be at odds with forest conservation (the work of preserving forests). However, a massive study in forest management and preservation spanning 700,000 hectares in Oregon's Malheur National Forest calls that view into question. So far, results of the study suggest that forest plots that have undergone limited logging (the careful removal of a controlled number of trees) may be more robust than plots that haven't been logged at all. These results, in turn, suggest that $\qquad$

Therefore,

Which choice most logically completes the text?
A) in order to increase their efficiency, authors who currently write their novels largely by hand should instead work only on a computer.
B) authors who do most of their drafting and revising by hand likely have more success than those who work entirely on a computer.
C) novels written by hand take less time to produce, on average, than novels written on a computer do.
D) there is no way to reasonably evaluate how a work would be different if it had been written by other means.
