The following text is adapted from Ida B. Wells's 1970 autobiography A Crusade for Justice. Mr. Watts is a reference to George Frederic Watts, an English painter.
[Manchester's] art galleries are so arranged that the name of every picture is plainly seen and one has no need of a catalogue to pick out the name and the artist. This is a convenience to the general public, which other art galleries, which shall be nameless, might copy to advantage. To her treasure of art Manchester has added Mr. Watts' latest picture, the Good Samaritan. (c) 1970 by the University of Chicago Press

Wakako Yamauchi is best known for And the Soul Shall Dance, her 1977 play about a Japanese American family in Southern California. The play is based on a short story Yamauchi had published three years earlier. Adapting the story wasn't easy. Theater relies on dialogue between characters, but the original story features little dialogue and instead describes its characters' silent thoughts. To transform the story into a play, Yamauchi created situations where characters reveal their thoughts by speaking them aloud during conversations with each other.

Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?
A) It offers information about how Yamauchi adapted her short story into a play.
B) It argues that Yamauchi's play influenced later playwrights.
C) It explains why Yamauchi's short story is better known than the play adaptation is.
D) It describes how Yamauchi chose the actors who performed in the play.

In response to concerns that some recent financial crises were exacerbated by consumers misunderstanding risks associated with credit cards, loans, and other financial products, policymakers in many countries have instituted risk-disclosure requirements on sellers of those products. Enrique Seira et al. investigated a variety of risk-disclosure messages sent to thousands of credit card customers and found that the messages had only small and short-lived effects on behavior. Seira et al. asserted that such effects may nevertheless be worth pursuing, given the negligible cost of messaging.
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?
A) It notes a factor that led Seira et al. to not dismiss risk-disclosure messaging altogether despite their evidence of its limited utility.
B) It acknowledges a type of risk-disclosure messaging that Seira et al. may not have fully accounted for in their study.
C) It describes a consideration that explains why Seira et al. recommended risk-disclosure messaging even though its effects may be small relative to its costs.
D) It points out a circumstance that Seira et al. conceded may make risk-disclosure messaging more effective than their study suggests.

## Text 1

When companies in the same industry propose merging with one another, they often claim that the merger will benefit consumers by increasing efficiency and therefore lowering prices. Economist Ying Fan investigated this notion in the context of the United States newspaper market. She modeled a hypothetical merger of Minneapolis-area newspapers and found that subscription prices would rise following a merger.

## Text 2

Economists Dario Focarelli and Fabio Panetta have argued that research on the effect of mergers on prices has focused excessively on short-term effects, which tend to be adverse for consumers. Using the case of consumer banking in Italy, they show that over the long term (several years, in their study), the efficiency gains realized by merged companies do result in economic benefits for consumers.
Based on the texts, how would Focarelli and Panetta (Text 2) most likely respond to Fan's findings (Text 1)?
A) They would recommend that Fan compare the near-term effect of a merger on subscription prices in the Minneapolis area with the effect of a merger in another newspaper market.
B) They would argue that over the long term the expenses incurred by the merged newspaper company will also increase.
C) They would encourage Fan to investigate whether the projected effect on subscription prices persists over an extended period.
D) They would claim that mergers have a different effect on consumer prices in the newspaper industry than in most other industries.

Utah is home to Pando, a colony of about 47,000 quaking aspen trees that all share a single root system. Pando is one of the largest single organisms by mass on Earth, but ecologists are worried that its growth is declining in part because of grazing by animals. The ecologists say that strong fences could prevent deer from eating young trees and help Pando start thriving again.

According to the text, why are ecologists worried about Pando?
A) It isn't growing at the same rate it used to.
B) It isn't producing young trees anymore.
C) It can't grow into new areas because it is blocked by fences.
D) Its root system can't support many more new trees.

Many plants lose their leaf color when exposed to kanamycin, an antibiotic produced by some soil microorganisms. Spelman College biologist Mentewab Ayalew and her colleagues hypothesized that plants' response to kanamycin exposure involves altering their uptake of metals, such as iron and zinc. The researchers grew two groups of seedlings of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, half of which were exposed to kanamycin and half of which were a control group without exposure to kanamycin, and measured the plants' metal content five days after germination.

Which choice best describes data in the graph that support Ayalew and her colleagues' hypothesis?
A) The control plants contained higher levels of zinc than iron, but plants exposed to kanamycin contained higher levels of iron than zinc.
B) Both groups of plants contained more than 200 parts per million of both iron and zinc.
C) Zinc levels were around 300 parts per million in the control plants but nearly 400 parts per million in the plants exposed to kanamycin.
D) The plants exposed to kanamycin showed lower levels of iron and zinc than the control plants did.

Average Number and Duration of Torpor Bouts and Arousal Episodes for Alaska Marmots and Arctic Ground Squirrels, 2008-2011

| Feature | Alaska marmots | Arctic ground <br> squirrels |
| :-- | :--: | :--: |
| torpor bouts | 12 | 10.5 |
| duration per bout | 13.81 days | 16.77 days |
| arousal episodes | 11 | 9.5 |
| duration per episode | 21.2 hours | 14.2 hours |

When hibernating, Alaska marmots and Arctic ground squirrels enter a state called torpor, which minimizes the energy their bodies need to function. Often a hibernating animal will temporarily come out of torpor (called an arousal episode) and its metabolic rate will rise, burning more of the precious energy the animal needs to survive the winter. Alaska marmots hibernate in groups and therefore burn less energy keeping warm during these episodes than they would if they were alone. A researcher hypothesized that because Arctic ground squirrels hibernate alone, they would likely exhibit longer bouts of torpor and shorter arousal episodes than Alaska marmots.

Which choice best describes data from the table that support the researcher's hypothesis?
A) The Alaska marmots' arousal episodes lasted for days, while the Arctic ground squirrels' arousal episodes lasted less than a day.
B) The Alaska marmots and the Arctic ground squirrels both maintained torpor for several consecutive days per bout, on average.
C) The Alaska marmots had shorter torpor bouts and longer arousal episodes than the Arctic ground squirrels did.
D) The Alaska marmots had more torpor bouts than arousal episodes, but their arousal episodes were much shorter than their torpor bouts.

Honeybee hives consist mainly of hexagonal (six-sided) units called cells, in which queens lay eggs. Hexagonal cells for eggs that develop into nonreproductive workers are smaller than those for eggs that develop into reproductive drones, though the size difference varies by species. Difference in cell size results in a construction problem-it's hard to neatly connect sections of small cells to sections of large cells-that worsens as the difference increases. To fill in gaps between the sections when building a hive, bees rely on cells that have more or fewer than six sides. A student studying beehive structure consults data on three species, concluding that $\qquad$

Which choice most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the student's conclusion?
A) cells for worker eggs are probably closer in size to cells for drone eggs in the hives of the western honeybee than in the hives of the dwarf honeybee and the black dwarf honeybee.
B) both the western honeybee and the black dwarf honeybee probably reserve eight-sided cells for drone eggs, while the dwarf honeybee likely deposits drone eggs in seven-sided cells.
C) the western honeybee probably relies on many more geometrical shapes when constructing cells than either the dwarf honeybee or the black dwarf honeybee does.
D) the percentage of hexagonal cells is probably slightly lower in the hives of the western honeybee than in the hives of the dwarf honeybee and the black dwarf honeybee.

ALSOL is a microcredit program in Mexico that makes small loans to female entrepreneurs who lack the collateral and credit history to secure financing from conventional banks. Borrowers use their business proceeds to repay loans in equal weekly installments and incur no penalty for missed payments other than lack of access to larger loans. Economists Gustavo Barboza and Sandra Trejos analyzed ALSOL data and found that rural borrowers, who mostly make and sell handicrafts, miss payments more often than urban borrowers do, partly because they sell their goods less frequently than they could. Barboza and Trejos claim that this behavior reflects strategic decisions that enable rural women to increase their profits per unit sold.

Which finding, if true, would most directly support Barboza and Trejos's claim?
A) Many marketplaces require entrepreneurs to pay marketplace operators a fixed percentage of each day's proceeds in exchange for permission to sell goods there.
B) Rural entrepreneurs can typically sell their goods for higher prices in cities than in their home areas, but the number of people selling competing goods tends to be higher in cities.
C) Due to the lower costs they incur, rural entrepreneurs tend to require smaller initial loans than urban entrepreneurs do.
D) The cost to rural entrepreneurs to bring their goods to towns with marketplaces is high but largely independent of the number of goods they bring.

In documents called judicial opinions, judges explain the reasoning behind their legal rulings, and in those explanations they sometimes cite and discuss historical and contemporary philosophers. Legal scholar and philosopher Anita L.

B) help judges improve the arguments they put forward in their judicial opinions.
C) make judicial opinions more comprehensible to readers without legal or philosophical training.
D) bring judicial opinions in line with views that are broadly held among philosophers.

Although military veterans make up a small proportion of the total population of the United States, they occupy a significantly higher proportion of the jobs in the civilian government.

The following text is from Edith Wharton's 1905 novel The House of Mirth. Lily Bart and a companion are walking through a park.

Lily had no real intimacy with nature, but she had a passion for the appropriate and could be keenly sensitive to a scene which was the fitting background of her own sensations. The landscape outspread below her seemed an enlargement of her present mood, and she found something of herself in its calmness, its breadth, its long free reaches. On the nearer slopes the sugar-maples wavered like pyres of light; lower down was a massing of grey orchards, and here and there the lingering green of an oak-grove.
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?
A) It creates a detailed image of the physical setting of the scene.
B) It establishes that a character is experiencing an internal conflict.
C) It makes an assertion that the next sentence then expands on.
D) It illustrates an idea that is introduced in the previous sentence.

Individual elephants and Arctic herbivores such as caribou tend to have fixed geographic ranges throughout their lifetimes, which had prompted some researchers to speculate that the Arctic woolly mammoth, an extinct elephantid, might have exhibited similar behavior. Mammoth tusks grew in sequential layers, incorporating ingested minerals and organics, and so each ivory stratum reflects the ratio of strontium isotopes $\left({ }^{87} \mathrm{Sr} /{ }^{86} \mathrm{Sr}\right)$ in the local environment; thus, the sequence of strata shows where the animal roamed during life. Recent analysis of the strontium ratios in the strata of one Arctic woolly mammoth tusk in relation to the geographic distribution of strontium ratios in the environment shows the animal's range begin to expand as it reached sexual maturity, only to contract again in its final 1.5 years.

Which choice best describes the function of the underlined statement in the text as a whole?
A) It discusses a characteristic shared by certain animals in order to explain why researchers raised a possibility that turned out not to be supported by data described later in the text.
B) It illustrates a pattern of behavior among certain animals in order to present a theory about exceptions to that pattern that is weakened by a finding described later in the text.
C) It describes a similarity in the behavior of certain animals in order to show why a method described later in the text did not reveal whether another animal also showed that behavior.
D) It introduces a trait shared by certain animals in order to contextualize a hypothesis about the origin of that trait that is advanced later in the text.

In the 1960s, Gloria Richardson led a movement to promote racial equality. Her involvement in this effort was inspired by her daughter, Donna Richardson. In 1961, Donna joined protests organized by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in Cambridge, Maryland. Following her daughter, Gloria joined these protests too. Gloria soon became the cochair of the Cambridge Nonviolent Action Committee. She was also the leader of what became known as the Cambridge movement.

According to the text, what did Gloria Richardson lead?

The following text is from Jane Austen's 1811 novel Sense and Sensibility. Elinor lives with her younger sisters and her mother, Mrs. Dashwood.

Elinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was so effectual, possessed a strength of understanding, and coolness of judgment, which qualified her, though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother, and enabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage of them all, that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have led to imprudence. She had an excellent heart;-her disposition was affectionate, and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to govern them: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn; and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught.

According to the text, what is true about Elinor?
A) Elinor often argues with her mother but fails to change her mind.
B) Elinor can be overly sensitive with regard to family matters.
C) Elinor thinks her mother is a bad role model.
D) Elinor is remarkably mature for her age.

Culinary anthropologist Vertamae Smart-Grosvenor may be known for her decades of work in national public television and radio, but her book Vibration Cooking: or, the Travel Notes of a Geechee Girl is likely her most influential project. The 1970 book, whose title refers to Smart-Grosvenor's roots in the Low Country of South Carolina, was unusual for its time.

"Mrs. Spring Fragrance" is a 1912 short story by Sui Sin Far. In the story, Mrs. Spring Fragrance, a Chinese immigrant living in Seattle, is traveling in California. In letters to her husband and friend, she demonstrates her concern for what's happening at her home in Seattle while she is away:

Which quotation from Mrs. Spring Fragrance's letters most effectively illustrates the claim?
A) "My honorable cousin is preparing for the Fifth Moon Festival, and wishes me to compound for the occasion some American 'fudge,' for which delectable sweet, made by my clumsy hands, you have sometimes shown a slight prejudice."
B) "Next week I accompany Ah Oi to the beauteous town of San José. There will we be met by the son of the Illustrious Teacher."
C) "Forget not to care for the cat, the birds, and the flowers. Do not eat too quickly nor fan too vigorously now that the weather is warming."
D) "I am enjoying a most agreeable visit, and American friends, as also our own, strive benevolently for the accomplishment of my pleasure."

When digging for clams, their primary food, sea otters damage the roots of eelgrass plants growing on the seafloor. Near Vancouver Island in Canada, the otter population is large and well established, yet the eelgrass meadows are healthier than those found elsewhere off Canada's coast. To explain this, conservation scientist Erin Foster and colleagues compared the Vancouver Island meadows to meadows where otters are absent or were reintroduced only recently. Finding that the Vancouver Island meadows have a more diverse gene pool than the others do, Foster hypothesized that damage to eelgrass roots increases the plant's rate of sexual reproduction; this, in turn, boosts genetic diversity, which benefits the meadows' health overall.

Which finding, if true, would most directly undermine Foster's hypothesis?
A) At some sites in the study, eelgrass meadows are found near otter populations that are small and have only recently been reintroduced.
B) At several sites not included in the study, there are large, well-established sea otter populations but no eelgrass meadows.
C) At several sites not included in the study, eelgrass meadows' health correlates negatively with the length of residence and size of otter populations.
D) At some sites in the study, the health of plants unrelated to eelgrass correlates negatively with the length of residence and size of otter populations.

In the twentieth century, ethnographers made a concerted effort to collect Mexican American folklore, but they did not always agree about that folklore's origins. Scholars such as Aurelio Espinosa claimed that Mexican American folklore derived largely from the folklore of Spain, which ruled Mexico and what is now the southwestern United States from the sixteenth to early nineteenth centuries. Scholars such as Américo Paredes, by contrast, argued that while some Spanish influence is undeniable, Mexican American folklore is mainly the product of the ongoing interactions of various cultures in Mexico and the United States.

Which finding, if true, would most directly support Paredes's argument?
A) The folklore that the ethnographers collected included several songs written in the form of a décima, a type of poem originating in late sixteenth-century Spain.
B) Much of the folklore that the ethnographers collected had similar elements from region to region.
C) Most of the folklore that the ethnographers collected was previously unknown to scholars.
D) Most of the folklore that the ethnographers collected consisted of corridos-ballads about history and social life-of a clearly recent origin.

Among social animals that care for their young, such as chickens, macaque monkeys, and humans, newborns appear to show an innate attraction to faces and face-like stimuli. Elisabetta Versace and her colleagues used an image of three black dots arranged in the shape of eyes and a nose or mouth to test whether this trait also occurs in Testudo tortoises, which live alone and do not engage in parental care. They found that tortoise hatchlings showed a significant preference for the image, suggesting that $\qquad$
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A) face-like stimuli are likely perceived as harmless by newborns of social species that practice parental care but as threatening by newborns of solitary species without parental care.
B) researchers should not assume that an innate attraction to face-like stimuli is necessarily an adaptation related to social interaction or parental care.
C) researchers can assume that the attraction to face-like stimuli that is seen in social species that practice parental care is learned rather than innate.
D) newly hatched Testudo tortoises show a stronger preference for face-like stimuli than adult Testudo tortoises do.

Aptamers-synthetic DNA or RNA molecules that bind to target molecules-can be used to test for foodborne bacterial pathogens, though their specificity (the probability of returning a negative result in the absence of the focal pathogen) in real-world foods has been unclear. Sandeep Somvanshi et al. fabricated test paper incorporating aptamers targeting strain O157:H7 of the bacteria Escherichia coli; the paper shifts from pink to purple as the aptamers bind to target molecules. Somvanshi et al. tested the paper in store-bought pear juice they treated with E. coli O157:H7, other strains of E. coli, or other bacteria species. Following exposure, the paper from the O157:H7 test was purple while papers from the other tests were pink, suggesting that $\qquad$
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A) aptamer-based tests in real-world foods are more likely to show a high degree of specificity if the focal pathogen is E. coli O157:H7 than if the focal pathogen is another strain of E. coli or another species.
B) uncertainty about the specificity of aptamer-based tests for pathogens in real-world foods may be due to the similarity between E. coli O157:H7 and other E. coli strains.
C) the specificity of the tests in a real-world food was unaffected by the aptamers' tendency to bind to different strains of E. coli.
D) the aptamers successfully bound to E. coli O157:H7 and the tests displayed a high degree of specificity in a real-world food.
