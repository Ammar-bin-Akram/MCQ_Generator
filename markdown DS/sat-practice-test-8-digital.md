The following text is from Sarah Orne Jewett's 1899 short story "Martha's Lady." Martha is employed by Miss Pyne as a maid.

Miss Pyne sat by the window watching, in her best dress, looking stately and calm; she seldom went out now, and it was almost time for the carriage. Martha was just coming in from the garden with the strawberries, and with more flowers in her apron. It was a bright cool evening in June, the golden robins sang in the elms, and the sun was going down behind the apple-trees at the foot of the garden. The beautiful old house stood wide open to the long-expected guest.

The following text is adapted from Aphra Behn's 1689 novel The Lucky Mistake. Atlante and Rinaldo are neighbors who have been secretly exchanging letters through Charlot, Atlante's sister.
[Atlante] gave this letter to Charlot; who immediately ran into the balcony with it, where she still found Rinaldo in a melancholy posture, leaning his head on his hand: She showed him the letter, but was afraid to toss it to him, for fear it might fall to the ground; so he ran and fetched a long cane, which he cleft at one end, and held it while she put the letter into the cleft, and stayed not to hear what he said to it. But never was man so transported with joy, as he was at the reading of this letter; it gives him new wounds; for to the generous, nothing obliges love so much as love.
Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?

B) It establishes that a character is desperate to receive a letter, and then explains why another character has not yet written that letter.
C) It presents a character's concerns about delivering a letter, and then details the contents of that letter.
D) It reveals the inspiration behind a character's letter, and then emphasizes the excitement that another character feels upon receiving that letter.

According to historian Vicki L. Ruiz, Mexican American women made crucial contributions to the labor movement during World War II. At the time, food processing companies entered into contracts to supply United States armed forces with canned goods. Increased production quotas conferred greater bargaining power on the companies' employees, many of whom were Mexican American women: employees insisted on more favorable benefits, and employers, who were anxious to fulfill the contracts, complied. Thus, labor activism became a platform for Mexican American women to assert their agency.

For many years, the only existing fossil evidence of mixopterid eurypterids-an extinct family of large aquatic arthropods known as sea scorpions and related to modern arachnids and horseshoe crabs-came from four species living on the paleocontinent of Laurussia. In a discovery that expands our understanding of the geographical distribution of mixopterids, paleontologist Bo Wang and others have identified fossilized remains of a new mixopterid species, Terropterus xiushanensis, that lived over 400 million years ago on the paleocontinent of Gondwana.

According to the text, why was Wang and his team's discovery of the Terropterus xiushanensis fossil significant?
A) The fossil constitutes the first evidence found by scientists that mixopterids lived more than 400 million years ago.
B) The fossil helps establish that mixopterids are more closely related to modern arachnids and horseshoe crabs than previously thought.
C) The fossil helps establish a more accurate timeline of the evolution of mixopterids on the paleocontinents of Laurussia and Gondwana.
D) The fossil constitutes the first evidence found by scientists that mixopterids existed outside the paleocontinent of Laurussia.

Researchers hypothesized that a decline in the population of dusky sharks near the mid-Atlantic coast of North America led to a decline in the population of eastern oysters in the region. Dusky sharks do not typically consume eastern oysters but do consume cownose rays, which are the main predators of the oysters.
Which finding, if true, would most directly support the researchers' hypothesis?
A) Declines in the regional abundance of dusky sharks' prey other than cownose rays are associated with regional declines in dusky shark abundance.
B) Eastern oyster abundance tends to be greater in areas with both dusky sharks and cownose rays than in areas with only dusky sharks.
C) Consumption of eastern oysters by cownose rays in the region substantially increased before the regional decline in dusky shark abundance began.
D) Cownose rays have increased in regional abundance as dusky sharks have decreased in regional abundance.

In the mountains of Brazil, Barbacenia tomentosa and Barbacenia macrantha-two plants in the Velloziaceae family-establish themselves on soilless, nutrient-poor patches of quartzite rock. Plant ecologists Anna Abrahão and Patricia de Britto Costa used microscopic analysis to determine that the roots of B. tomentosa and B. macrantha, which grow directly into the quartzite, have clusters of fine hairs near the root tip; further analysis indicated that these hairs secrete both malic and citric acids. The researchers hypothesize that the plants depend on dissolving underlying rock with these acids, as the process not only creates channels for continued growth but also releases phosphates that provide the vital nutrient phosphorus.

Which finding, if true, would most directly support the researchers' hypothesis?
A) Other species in the Velloziaceae family are found in terrains with more soil but have root structures similar to those of B. tomentosa and B. macrantha.
B) Though B. tomentosa and B. macrantha both secrete citric and malic acids, each species produces the acids in different proportions.
C) The roots of B. tomentosa and B. macrantha carve new entry points into rocks even when cracks in the surface are readily available.
D) B. tomentosa and B. macrantha thrive even when transferred to the surfaces of rocks that do not contain phosphates.

Many mosquito repellents contain natural components that work by activating multiple odor receptors on mosquitoes' antennae. As the insects develop resistance, new repellents are needed. Ke Dong and her team found that EBF, a molecular component of a chrysanthemum-flower extract, can repel mosquitoes by activating just one odor receptor-and this receptor, Or31, is present in all mosquito species known to carry diseases. Therefore, the researchers suggest that in developing new repellents, it would be most useful to $\qquad$
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A) identify molecular components similar to EBF that target the activation of Or31 receptors.
B) investigate alternative methods for extracting EBF molecules from chrysanthemums.
C) verify the precise locations of Or31 and other odor receptors on mosquitoes' antennae.
D) determine the maximum number of different odor receptors that can be activated by a single molecule.

Birds of many species ingest foods containing carotenoids, pigmented molecules that are converted into feather coloration. Coloration tends to be especially saturated in male birds' feathers, and because carotenoids also confer health benefits, the deeply saturated colors generally serve to communicate what is known as an honest signal of a bird's overall fitness to potential mates. However, ornithologist Allison J. Shultz and others have found that males in several species of the tanager genus Ramphocelus use microstructures in their feathers to manipulate light, creating the appearance of deeper saturation without the birds necessarily having to maintain a carotenoid-rich diet. These findings suggest that $\qquad$
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A) individual male tanagers can engage in honest signaling without relying on carotenoid consumption.
B) feather microstructures may be less effective than deeply saturated feathers for signaling overall fitness.
C) scientists have yet to determine why tanagers have a preference for mates with colorful appearances.
D) a male tanager's appearance may function as a dishonest signal of the individual's overall fitness.

## Text 1

Ecologists have long wondered how thousands of microscopic phytoplankton species can live together near ocean surfaces competing for the same resources. According to conventional wisdom, one species should emerge after outcompeting the rest. So why do so many species remain? Ecologists' many efforts to explain this phenomenon still haven't uncovered a satisfactory explanation.

## Text 2

Ecologist Michael Behrenfeld and colleagues have connected phytoplankton's diversity to their microscopic size. Because these organisms are so tiny, they are spaced relatively far apart from each other in ocean water and, moreover, experience that water as a relatively dense substance. This in turn makes it hard for them to move around and interact with one another. Therefore, says Behrenfeld's team, direct competition among phytoplankton probably happens much less than previously thought.
Based on the texts, how would Behrenfeld and colleagues (Text 2) most likely respond to the "conventional wisdom" discussed in Text 1?
A) By arguing that it is based on a misconception about phytoplankton species competing with one another
B) By asserting that it fails to recognize that routine replenishment of ocean nutrients prevents competition between phytoplankton species
C) By suggesting that their own findings help clarify how phytoplankton species are able to compete with larger organisms
D) By recommending that more ecologists focus their research on how competition among phytoplankton species is increased with water density

The following text is adapted from Sylvia Acevedo's 2018 memoir Path to the Stars: My Journey from Girl Scout to Rocket Scientist. The narrator is traveling by car with her family to Mexico City. Mario and Laura are her brother and sister.

Mario and I played games to see how many different license plates we could spot, and Laura liked to look for children in the back seats of the cars we passed. We were used to the forty-fiveminute drive to El Paso and familiar with the six-hour ride to Chihuahua, but I wondered what the long journey to Mexico City would be like.
(c)2018 by Sylvia Acevedo

According to the text, what did the narrator and Mario do while riding in the car?
A) They read books.
B) They sang songs.
C) They went to sleep.
D) They played games.

In the 1700s and 1800s, European composers experimented with volume in their musical works. They did so by increasing the number of musicians playing in the orchestra. For example, in some of his operas, German composer Richard Wagner added more horns, trombones, and tubas to the orchestra. With more instruments playing at the same time, the orchestra could play extremely loudly at key moments in his operas.

According to the text, how did Richard Wagner achieve moments of extremely high volume in his operas?
A) By moving the performances of his operas from outdoor stages to indoor ones
B) By increasing the number of musicians playing horns, trombones, and tubas in the orchestra
C) By building a concert hall whose shape would cause sounds to echo
D) By insisting that the singers undergo special training to sing for extended periods of time

Poetry in Classical Nahuatl, the language of the Aztec Empire, relies on difrasismo, or a parallel noun construction that conventionally operates as a single metaphor. For example, the common difrasismo in cuauhtli in ocelotl (literally, "the eagle, the jaguar") signifies "warrior." The device's function is both formal—providing structure to lines of verse-and ritual: semantic relations among the two nouns and the concept they signify can be tenuous, as in the previous example, such that difrasismos are often only intelligible according to the conceptual associations observed in Aztec ceremonial culture.

Eighteenth-century economist Adam Smith is famed for his metaphor of the invisible hand, which he putatively used to illustrate a robust model of how individuals produce aggregate benefits by pursuing their own economic interests. Note "putatively": as Gavin Kennedy has shown, Smith deploys this metaphor only once in his economic writings-to make a narrow point about the then-dominant economic theory of mercantilism-and it was largely ignored until some twentieth-century economists eager to secure an intellectual pedigree for their views elevated it to a fully-fledged paradigm.

Which choice best states the main idea of the text?
A) Although Smith is famed for his metaphor of the invisible hand, the metaphor was largely ignored until economists in the twentieth century came to realize that the metaphor was a robust model that anticipated their own views.
B) Some twentieth-century economists gave Smith's metaphor of the invisible hand a significance it does not have in Smith's work, but it is nevertheless a useful model of how individuals produce aggregate benefits by pursuing their own economic interests.
C) Smith's metaphor of the invisible hand has been interpreted as a model of how individuals acting in their own interest produce aggregate benefits, but it was intended as a subtle critique of the economic theory of mercantilism.
D) The reputation of Smith's metaphor of the invisible hand is not due to the importance of the metaphor in Smith's work but rather to the promotion of the metaphor by some later economists for their own ends.

Approximate Rates of Speech and Information Conveyed for Five Languages

| Language | Rate of speech <br> (syllables <br> per second) | Rate of information <br> conveyed (bits <br> per second) |
| :-- | :--: | :--: |
| Serbian | 7.2 | 39.1 |
| Spanish | 7.7 | 42.0 |
| Vietnamese | 5.3 | 42.5 |
| Thai | 4.7 | 33.8 |
| Hungarian | 5.9 | 34.6 |

A group of researchers working in Europe, Asia, and Oceania conducted a study to determine how quickly different Eurasian languages are typically spoken (in syllables per second) and how much information they can effectively convey (in bits per second). They found that, although languages vary widely in the speed at which they are spoken, the amount of information languages can effectively convey tends to vary much less. Thus, they claim that two languages with very different spoken rates can nonetheless convey the same amount of information in a given amount of time.

Which choice best describes data from the table that support the researchers' claim?
A) Among the five languages in the table, Thai and Hungarian have the lowest rates of speech and the lowest rates of information conveyed.
B) Vietnamese conveys information at approximately the same rate as Spanish despite being spoken at a slower rate.
C) Among the five languages in the table, the language that is spoken the fastest is also the language that conveys information the fastest.
D) Serbian and Spanish are spoken at approximately the same rate, but Serbian conveys information faster than Spanish does.

Estimates of Tyrannosaurid Bite Force

| Study | Year | Estimation method | Approximate bite force <br> (newtons) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :--: |
| Cost et al. | 2019 | muscular and skeletal modeling | $35,000-63,000$ |
| Gignac and Erickson | 2017 | tooth-bone interaction analysis | $8,000-34,000$ |
| Meers | 2002 | body-mass scaling | $183,000-235,000$ |
| Bates and Falkingham | 2012 | muscular and skeletal modeling | $35,000-57,000$ |

The largest tyrannosaurids-the family of carnivorous dinosaurs that includes Tarbosaurus, Albertosaurus, and, most famously, Tyrannosaurus rex-are thought to have had the strongest bites of any land animals in Earth's history. Determining the bite force of extinct animals can be difficult, however, and paleontologists Paul Barrett and Emily Rayfield have suggested that an estimate of dinosaur bite force may be significantly influenced by the methodology used in generating that estimate.

Which choice best describes data from the table that support Barrett and Rayfield's suggestion?
A) The study by Meers used body-mass scaling and produced the lowest estimated maximum bite force, while the study by Cost et al. used muscular and skeletal modeling and produced the highest estimated maximum.
B) In their study, Gignac and Erickson used tooth-bone interaction analysis to produce an estimated bite force range with a minimum of 8,000 newtons and a maximum of 34,000 newtons.
C) The bite force estimates produced by Bates and Falkingham and by Cost et al. were similar to each other, while the estimates produced by Meers and by Gignac and Erickson each differed substantially from any other estimate.
D) The estimated maximum bite force produced by Cost et al. exceeded the estimated maximum produced by Bates and Falkingham, even though both groups of researchers used the same method to generate their estimates.

Psychologists Dacher Keltner and Jonathan Haidt have argued that experiencing awe-a sensation of reverence and wonder typically brought on by perceiving something grand or powerful-can enable us to feel more connected to others and thereby inspire us to act more altruistically. Keltner, along with Paul K. Piff, Pia Dietze, and colleagues, claims to have found evidence for this effect in a recent study where participants were asked to either gaze up at exceptionally tall trees in a nearby grove (reported to be a universally awe-inspiring experience) or stare at the exterior of a nearby, nondescript building. After one minute, an experimenter deliberately spilled a box of pens nearby.
Which finding from the researchers' study, if true, would most strongly support their claim?
A) Participants who had been looking at the trees helped the experimenter pick up significantly more pens than did participants who had been looking at the building.
B) Participants who helped the experimenter pick up the pens used a greater number of positive words to describe the trees and the building in a postexperiment survey than did participants who did not help the experimenter.
C) Participants who did not help the experimenter pick up the pens were significantly more likely to report having experienced a feeling of awe, regardless of whether they looked at the building or the trees.
D) Participants who had been looking at the building were significantly more likely to notice that the experimenter had dropped the pens than were participants who had been looking at the trees.

The domestic sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) descends from a wild plant native to South America. It also populates the Polynesian Islands, where evidence confirms that Native Hawaiians and other Indigenous peoples were cultivating the plant centuries before seafaring first occurred over the thousands of miles of ocean separating them from South America. To explain how the sweet potato was first introduced in Polynesia, botanist Pablo Muñoz-Rodríguez and colleagues analyzed the DNA of numerous varieties of the plant, concluding that Polynesian varieties diverged from South American ones over 100,000 years ago. Given that Polynesia was peopled only in the last three thousand years, the team concluded that $\qquad$
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A) the cultivation of the sweet potato in Polynesia likely predates its cultivation in South America.
B) Polynesian peoples likely acquired the sweet potato from South American peoples only within the last three thousand years.
C) human activity likely played no role in the introduction of the sweet potato in Polynesia.
D) Polynesian sweet potato varieties likely descend from a single South American variety that was domesticated, not wild.

The morphological novelty of echinoderms-marine invertebrates with radial symmetry, usually starlike, around a central point-impedes comparisons with most other animals, in which bilateral symmetry on an anterior-posterior (head to tail) axis through a trunk is typical. Particularly puzzling are sea stars, thought to have evolved a headless layout from a known bilateral origin. Applying genomic knowledge of Saccoglossus kowalevskii acorn worms (close relatives of sea stars, and thus expected to have similar markers for corresponding anatomical regions) to the body patterning genes of Patiria miniata sea stars, Laurent Formery et al. observed activity only in anterior genes across $P$. miniata's entire body and some posterior genes limited to the edges, suggesting that $\qquad$
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A) despite the greater prevalence of anterior genes in sea stars' genetic makeup, posterior genes active at the body's perimeter are primarily responsible for the starlike layout that distinguishes sea stars' radial symmetry from that of other echinoderms.
B) contrary to the belief that they evolved from early ancestors with the bilateral form typical of many other animals, sea stars instead originated with an atypical body layout that was neither bilaterally nor radially symmetrical.
C) although the two species are closely related, there is only minimal correspondence in the genetic markers for head, tail, and trunk region development in P. miniata sea stars and S. kowalevskii acorn worms.
D) rather than undergoing changes resulting in the eventual elimination of a head region in their radial body plan, as previously assumed, sea stars' morphology evolved to completely lack a trunk and consist primarily of a head region.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:

- Some sandstone arches in Utah's Arches National Park have been defaced by tourists' carvings.
- Park rangers can smooth away some carvings using power grinders.
- For deep carvings, power grinding is not always feasible because it can greatly alter or damage the rock.
- Park rangers can use an infilling technique, which involves filling in carvings with ground sandstone and a bonding agent.
- This technique is minimally invasive.

The student wants to explain an advantage of the infilling technique. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?
A) To remove carvings from sandstone arches in Utah's Arches National Park, power grinding is not always feasible.
B) Filling in carvings with ground sandstone and a bonding agent is less invasive than smoothing them away with a power grinder, which can greatly alter or damage the sandstone arches.
C) Park rangers can use a power grinding technique to smooth away carvings or fill them in with ground sandstone and a bonding agent.
