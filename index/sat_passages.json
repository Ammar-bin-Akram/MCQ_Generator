Studying wavelengths of light in the white dwarf atmospheres, the team reported that traces of elements such as lithium and sodium support the presence of exoplanets with continental crusts similar to Earth's.\n\n## Text 2\n\nPast studies of white dwarf atmospheres have concluded that certain exoplanets had continental crusts. Geologist Keith Putirka and astronomer Siyi Xu argue that those studies unduly emphasize atmospheric traces of lithium and other individual elements as signifiers of the types of rock found on Earth. The studies don't adequately account for different minerals made up of various ratios of those elements, and the possibility of rock types not found on Earth that contain those minerals.\n\nBased on the texts, how would Putirka and Xu (Text 2) most likely characterize the conclusion presented in Text 1?\nA) As unexpected, because it was widely believed at the time that white dwarf exoplanets lack continental crusts\nB) As premature, because researchers have only just begun trying to determine what kinds of crusts white dwarf exoplanets had\nC) As questionable, because it rests on an incomplete consideration of potential sources of the elements detected in white dwarf atmospheres\nD) As puzzling, because it's unusual to successfully detect lithium and sodium when analyzing wavelengths of light in white dwarf atmospheres\n\nThe following text is from David Barclay Moore's 2022 novel Holler of the Fireflies.

I did feel scared, but also excited.\n(c)2022 by David Barclay Moore\n\nAccording to the text, how does the narrator feel about being at summer camp?\nA) He feels overjoyed.\nB) He feels peaceful.\nC) He feels both scared and excited.\nD) He feels both angry and jealous.\n\n12\nThe following text is adapted from Oscar Wilde's 1891 novel The Picture of Dorian Gray. Dorian Gray is taking his first look at a portrait that Hallward has painted of him.\n\nDorian passed listlessly in front of his picture and turned towards it. When he saw it he drew back, and his cheeks flushed for a moment with pleasure. A look of joy came into his eyes, as if he had recognized himself for the first time. He stood there motionless and in wonder, dimly conscious that Hallward was speaking to him, but not catching the meaning of his words. The sense of his own beauty came on him like a revelation. He had never felt it before.\n\nAccording to the text, what is true about Dorian?\nA) He wants to know Hallward's opinion of the portrait.\nB) He is delighted by what he sees in the portrait.\nC) He prefers portraits to other types of paintings.\nD) He is uncertain of Hallward's talent as an artist.\n",

These elements include leather fringe and jingles, the metal cones that cover the dresses worn in the jingle dance, a women's dance of the Ojibwe people. Thus, Gibson combines an object commonly associated with masculinity (a punching bag) with art forms traditionally practiced by women in most Native communities (beadwork and dressmaking). In this way, he rejects the division of male and female gender roles.\n\nWhich choice best describes Gibson's approach to art, as presented in the text?\nA) He draws from traditional Native art forms to create his original works.\nB) He has been influenced by Native and non-Native artists equally.\nC) He finds inspiration from boxing in designing the dresses he makes.\nD) He rejects expectations about color and pattern when incorporating beadwork.\n",

In the novel, Cather portrays Alexandra Bergson as having a deep emotional connection to her natural surroundings:\n\nWhich quotation from O Pioneers! most effectively illustrates the claim?\nA) \"She had never known before how much the country meant to her. The chirping of the insects down in the long grass had been like the sweetest music. She had felt as if her heart were hiding down there, somewhere, with the quail and the plover and all the little wild things that crooned or buzzed in the sun. Under the long shaggy ridges, she felt the future stirring.\"\nB) \"Alexandra talked to the men about their crops and to the women about their poultry. She spent a whole day with one young farmer who had been away at school, and who was experimenting with a new kind of clover hay. She learned a great deal.\"\nC) \"Alexandra drove off alone. The rattle of her wagon was lost in the howling of the wind, but her lantern, held firmly between her feet, made a moving point of light along the highway, going deeper and deeper into the dark country.\"\nD) \"It was Alexandra who read the papers and followed the markets, and who learned by the mistakes of their neighbors. It was Alexandra who could always tell about what it had cost to fatten each steer, and who could guess the weight of a hog before it went on the scales closer than John Bergson [her father] himself.\"\n\nThe novelist Toni Morrison was the first Black woman to work as an editor at the publishing company Random House, from 1967 to 1983. A scholar asserts that one of Morrison's likely aims during her time as an editor was to strengthen the presence of Black writers on the list of Random House's published authors.\n\nWhich finding, if true, would most strongly support the scholar's claim?\nA) The percentage of authors published by Random House who were Black rose in the early 1970s and stabilized throughout the decade.\nB) Black authors who were interviewed in the 1980s and 1990s were highly likely to cite Toni Morrison's novels as a principal influence on their work.\nC) The novels written by Toni Morrison that were published after 1983 sold significantly more copies and received wider critical acclaim than the novels she wrote that were published before 1983.\nD) Works that were edited by Toni Morrison during her time at Random House displayed stylistic characteristics that distinguished them from works that were not edited by Morrison.\n\nArchaeologist Petra Vaiglova, anthropologist Xinyi Liu, and their colleagues investigated the domestication of farm animals in China during the Bronze Age (approximately 2000 to 1000 BCE). By analyzing the chemical composition of the bones of sheep, goats, and cattle from this era, the team determined that wild plants made up the bulk of sheep's and goats' diets, while the cattle's diet consisted largely of millet, a crop cultivated by humans. The team concluded that cattle were likely raised closer to human settlements, whereas sheep and goats were allowed to roam farther away.\n\nWhich finding, if true, would most strongly support the team's conclusion?\nA) Analysis of the animal bones showed that the cattle's diet also consisted of wheat, which humans widely cultivated in China during the Bronze Age.\nB) Further investigation of sheep and goat bones revealed that their diets consisted of small portions of millet as well.\nC) Cattle's diets generally require larger amounts of food and a greater variety of nutrients than do sheep's and goats' diets.\nD) The diets of sheep, goats, and cattle were found to vary based on what the farmers in each Bronze Age settlement could grow.\n\n[Image removed]\n\nIn a study of the evolution of DptA and DptB-Diptericin genes encoding antimicrobial peptides that combat pathogens and foster beneficial microbes in fruit flies (Drosophila)—researchers assessed Drosophila melanogaster resistance to pathogenic infections by Providencia rettgeri and Acetobacter sicerae, bacteria common in the flies' environments.

One limitation of the cells, however, has to do with their electron transport layer (ETL), through which absorbed electrons must pass. Often the ETL is applied through a process called spin coating, but such ETLs are fairly inefficient at converting input power to output power. André Taylor and colleagues tested a novel spray coating method for applying the ETL.

The researchers hypothesize that fork-tailed flycatcher females are attracted to the specific sound made by the males of their own subspecies, and that over time the females' preference will drive further genetic and anatomical divergence between the subspecies.\n\nWhich finding, if true, would most directly support Gómez-Bahamón and her team's hypothesis?\nA) The feathers located on the wings of the migratory fork-tailed flycatchers have a narrower shape than those of the nonmigratory birds, which allows them to fly long distances.\nB) Over several generations, the sound made by the feathers of migratory male fork-tailed flycatchers grows progressively higher pitched relative to that made by the feathers of nonmigratory males.\nC) Fork-tailed flycatchers communicate different messages to each other depending on whether their feathers create high-pitched or low-pitched sounds.\nD) The breeding habits of the migratory and nonmigratory fork-tailed flycatchers remained generally the same over several generations.\n\nAblation Rates for Three Elements in Cosmic Dust, by Dust Source\n\n| Element | SPC | AST | HTC | OCC |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| iron | $20 \\%$ | $28 \\%$ | $90 \\%$ | $98 \\%$ |\n| potassium | $44 \\%$ | $74 \\%$ | $97 \\%$ | $100 \\%$ |\n| sodium | $45 \\%$ | $75 \\%$ | $99 \\%$ | $100 \\%$ |\n\nEarth's atmosphere is bombarded by cosmic dust originating from several sources: short-period comets (SPCs), particles from the asteroid belt (ASTs), Halley-type comets (HTCs), and Oort cloud comets (OCCs).

In the story, the narrator takes an unnamed seventeen-year-old girl and her younger brother out for a meal. In describing the teenager, Mansfield frequently contrasts the character's pleasant appearance with her unpleasant attitude, as when Mansfield writes of the teenager, $\\qquad$\nWhich quotation from \"The Young Girl\" most effectively illustrates the claim?\nA) \"I heard her murmur, 'I can't bear flowers on a table.' They had evidently been giving her intense pain, for she positively closed her eyes as I moved them away.\"\nB) \"While we waited she took out a little, gold powder-box with a mirror in the lid, shook the poor little puff as though she loathed it, and dabbed her lovely nose.\"\nC) \"I saw, after that, she couldn't stand this place a moment longer, and, indeed, she jumped up and turned away while I went through the vulgar act of paying for the tea.\"\nD) \"She didn't even take her gloves off. She lowered her eyes and drummed on the table. When a faint violin sounded she winced and bit her lip again. Silence.\"\n\n[Image removed]\n\nHigh levels of public uncertainty about which economic policies a country will adopt can make planning difficult for businesses, but measures of such uncertainty have not tended to be very detailed. Recently, however, economist Sandile Hlatshwayo analyzed trends in news reports to derive measures not only for general economic policy uncertainty but also for uncertainty related to specific areas of economic policy, like tax or trade policy. One revelation of her work is that a general measure may not fully reflect uncertainty about specific areas of policy, as in the case of the United Kingdom, where general economic policy uncertainty $\\qquad$\n\nWhich choice most effectively uses data from the graph to illustrate the claim?\nA) aligned closely with uncertainty about tax and public spending policy in 2005 but differed from uncertainty about tax and public spending policy by a large amount in 2009.\nB) was substantially lower than uncertainty about tax and public spending policy each year from 2005 to 2010.\nC) reached its highest level between 2005 and 2010 in the same year that uncertainty about trade policy and tax and public spending policy reached their lowest levels.\nD) was substantially lower than uncertainty about trade policy in 2005 and substantially higher than uncertainty about trade policy in 2010.\n\nLinguist Deborah Tannen has cautioned against framing contentious issues in terms of two highly competitive perspectives, such as pro versus con. According to Tannen, this debate-driven approach can strip issues of their complexity and, when used in front of an audience, can be less informative than the presentation of multiple perspectives in a noncompetitive format. To test Tannen's hypothesis, students conducted a study in which they showed participants one of three different versions of local news commentary about the same issue. Each version featured a debate between two commentators with opposing views, a panel of three commentators with various views, or a single commentator.\n\nWhich finding from the students' study, if true, would most strongly support Tannen's hypothesis?\nA) On average, participants perceived commentators in the debate as more knowledgeable about the issue than commentators in the panel.\nB) On average, participants perceived commentators in the panel as more knowledgeable about the issue than the single commentator.\nC) On average, participants who watched the panel correctly answered more questions about the issue than those who watched the debate or the single commentator did.\nD) On average, participants who watched the single commentator correctly answered more questions about the issue than those who watched the debate did.\n",

For instance, Romeo and Juliet, which is set in the Italy of Shakespeare's time, tackles the themes of parents versus children and love versus hate, and the play continues to be read and produced widely around the world. But understanding Shakespeare's so-called history plays can require a knowledge of several centuries of English history. Consequently, $\\qquad$\nWhich choice most logically completes the text?\nA) many theatergoers and readers today are likely to find Shakespeare's history plays less engaging than the tragedies.\nB) some of Shakespeare's tragedies are more relevant to today's audiences than twentieth-century plays.\nC) Romeo and Juliet is the most thematically accessible of all Shakespeare's tragedies.\nD) experts in English history tend to prefer Shakespeare's history plays to his other works.\n\nAncestral Puebloans, the civilization from which present-day Pueblo tribes descended, emerged as early as 1500 B.C.E. in an area of what is now the southwestern United States and dispersed suddenly in the late 1200s C.E., abandoning established villages with systems for farming crops and turkeys. Recent analysis comparing turkey remains at Mesa Verde, one such village in southern Colorado, to samples from modern turkey populations in the Rio Grande Valley of north central New Mexico determined that the latter birds descended in part from turkeys cultivated at Mesa Verde, with shared genetic markers appearing only after 1280. Thus, researchers concluded that $\\qquad$\nWhich choice most logically completes the text?\nA) conditions of the terrains in the Rio Grande Valley and Mesa Verde had greater similarities in the past than they do today.\nB) some Ancestral Puebloans migrated to the Rio Grande Valley in the late 1200s and carried farming practices with them.\nC) Indigenous peoples living in the Rio Grande Valley primarily planted crops and did not cultivate turkeys before 1280.\nD) the Ancestral Puebloans of Mesa Verde likely adopted the farming practices of Indigenous peoples living in other regions.\n\nOne challenge when researching whether holding elected office changes a person's behavior is the problem of ensuring that the experiment has an appropriate control group.

The shift to agriculture about 12,000 years ago sparked population growth that led to the emergence of groups with hierarchical structures: associations of clans first, then chiefdoms, and finally, bureaucratic states.\n\n## Text 2\n\nIn a 2021 book, anthropologist David Graeber and archaeologist David Wengrow maintain that humans have always been socially flexible, alternately forming systems based on hierarchy and collective ones with decentralized leadership. The authors point to evidence that as far back as 50,000 years ago some hunter-gatherers adjusted their social structures seasonally, at times dispersing in small groups but also assembling into communities that included esteemed individuals.\n\nBased on the texts, how would Graeber and Wengrow (Text 2) most likely respond to the \"conventional wisdom\" presented in Text 1?\nA) By conceding the importance of hierarchical systems but asserting the greater significance of decentralized collective societies\nB) By disputing the idea that developments in social structures have followed a linear progression through distinct stages\nC) By acknowledging that hierarchical roles likely weren't a part of social systems before the rise of agriculture\nD) By challenging the assumption that groupings of hunter-gatherers were among the earliest forms of social structure\n",

Hypothesizing that differences in land use lead to differences in carbon and nitrogen levels that are not restricted to the topsoil layer ( $0-30 \\mathrm{~cm}$ deep), Chukwuebuka Okolo and colleagues sampled soils across multiple land-use types (e.g., grazing land, cropland, forest) within each of several Ethiopian locations.

Now, scientists believe that there could be areas of active magma flows deep beneath the planet's surface that trigger the marsquakes.\n\nAccording to the text, what was surprising to scientists studying the seismic activity data from NASA's InSight lander?\nA) The surface temperature of Mars has been rising.\nB) There were different types of seismic waves causing marsquakes.\nC) NASA's InSight lander collected less data than scientists had expected.\nD) All the marsquakes started from the same location on the planet.\n",

In the film The Godfather Part II, the fabula is the story of the Corleone family, and the syuzhet is the presentation of the story as it alternates between two timelines in 1901 and 1958.

University of Texas climate scientist Geeta Persad and her colleagues simulated how the amount of water entering aquifers and the amount being used for irrigation purposes would change if this were to occur. Persad and her colleagues concluded that concentration of precipitation into fewer events would result in a higher number of dry days, triggering more irrigation, but that this change in irrigation output is highly sensitive to the baseline concentration of precipitation that currently exists in an area.\n\nWhich choice best describes data from the table that support Persad and her colleagues' conclusion?\nA) If baseline precipitation is somewhat concentrated, the amount of water being used for irrigation will increase $0.4 \\%$ for surface water and $0.9 \\%$ for groundwater, whereas the amount of water entering aquifers will increase $11.0 \\%$ if baseline precipitation is evenly distributed.\nB) If baseline precipitation is somewhat concentrated, water use for irrigation will increase only slightly, whereas it will increase $9.0 \\%$ for surface water and $7.9 \\%$ for groundwater if baseline precipitation is evenly distributed.\nC) If baseline precipitation is somewhat concentrated, the amount of water entering aquifers will increase $4.9 \\%$, while the amount being used for irrigation will increase $0.4 \\%$ for surface water and $0.9 \\%$ for groundwater.\nD) If baseline precipitation is somewhat concentrated, water use for irrigation will decline by a small amount, whereas it will increase $11.0 \\%$ for surface water and $9.0 \\%$ for groundwater if baseline precipitation is evenly distributed.\n\nIn dialects of English spoken in Scotland, the \" r \" sound is strongly emphasized when it appears at the end of syllables (as in \"car\") or before other consonant sounds (as in \"bird\").

Evelyne Huebscher and colleagues attribute this incongruity to governments' tendency-not followed in the recent European cases-to implement austerity programs strategically to avoid electoral costs (e.g., setting spending cuts to take effect only after the next election), which has obscured the inherent political risks of austerity measures in the election data scholars have examined.\n\nWhich choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?\nA) It explains a discrepancy between what has been observed in study settings and what has been observed in real-world settings that the text goes on to assert is attributable to the studies not using real-world data.\nB) It identifies a conflict between research findings and recent events that the text goes on to suggest is a consequence of a complicating factor in the data used to generate those findings.\nC) It presents a long-standing divergence in research findings that the text goes on to say is due to different groups of researchers using data that derive from different electoral circumstances.\nD) It describes a recent exception to a general pattern in research findings that the text goes on to explain is a result of researchers underestimating the significance of inconsistencies in the data they've analyzed.\n\n8\n\n## Text 1\n\nGraphic novels are increasingly popular in bookstores and libraries, but they shouldn't be classified as literature. By definition, literature tells a story or conveys meaning through language only; graphic novels tell stories through illustrations and use language only sparingly, in captions and dialogue. Graphic novels are experienced as series of images and not as language, making them more similar to film than to literature.\n\n## Text 2\n\nGraphic novels present their stories through both language and images. Without captions and dialogue, readers would be unable to understand what is depicted in the illustrations: the story results from the interaction of text and image. Moreover, Alison Bechdel's Fun Home and many other graphic novels feature text that is as beautifully written as the prose found in many standard novels. Therefore, graphic novels qualify as literary texts.\nBased on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the overall argument presented in Text 1?\nA) By asserting that language plays a more important role in graphic novels than the author of Text 1 recognizes\nB) By acknowledging that the author of Text 1 has identified a flaw that is common to all graphic novels\nC) By suggesting that the story lines of certain graphic novels are more difficult to understand than the author of Text 1 claims\nD) By agreeing with the author of Text 1 that most graphic novels aren't as well crafted as most literary works are\n\n9\nThe following text is adapted from Ann Petry's 1946 novel The Street.

Stefano Boeri intended his design, which features balconies that are home to hundreds of trees, to serve as a model for promoting urban biodiversity. However, the concept has faced skepticism: critics note that although the trees used in Bosco Verticale were specifically cultivated for the project, it's too early to tell if they can thrive in this unusual setting.\n\nAccording to the text, why are some critics skeptical of the concept behind Bosco Verticale?\nA) Some essential aspects of Bosco Verticale's design are difficult to adapt to locations other than Milan.\nB) The plant life on Bosco Verticale ended up being less varied than Boeri had envisioned it would be.\nC) The construction of Bosco Verticale was no less environmentally damaging than the construction of more conventional buildings is.\nD) It is unclear whether Bosco Verticale can support the plant life included in its design.\n",

Jingcheng Huang, Sara Seager, and colleagues evaluated this possibility, finding that on rocky planets, atmospheric $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ likely couldn't reach detectably high levels in the absence of biological activity. But the team also found that on so-called mini-Neptunes-gas planets smaller than Neptune but with atmospheres similar to Neptune's-atmospheric pressure and temperature can be high enough to produce atmospheric $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$.\n\nBased on the text, Huang, Seager, and colleagues would most likely agree with which statement about atmospheric $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ ?\nA) Its presence is more likely to indicate that a planet is a mini-Neptune than that the planet is a rocky planet that could support life.\nB) Its absence from a planet that's not a mini-Neptune indicates that the planet probably doesn't have life.\nC) It should be treated as a biosignature gas if detected in the atmosphere of a rocky planet but not if detected in the atmosphere of a mini-Neptune.\nD) It doesn't reliably reach high enough concentrations in the atmospheres of rocky planets or mini-Neptunes to be treated as a biosignature gas.\n\n[Image removed]\n\nIn 2021, four of the United States national parks that were among the most visited were Grand Canyon National Park, Rocky Mountain National Park, Yellowstone National Park, and Zion National Park.

In the poem, the speaker describes having contradictory feelings while experiencing the sights and sounds of a spring day: $\\qquad$\nWhich quotation from \"Lines Written in Early Spring\" most effectively illustrates the claim?\nA) \"Through primrose-tufts, in that sweet bower, / The periwinkle trail'd its wreathes; / And 'tis my faith that every flower / Enjoys the air it breathes.\"\nB) \"The budding twigs spread out their fan, / To catch the breezy air; / And I must think, do all I can, / That there was pleasure there.\"\nC) \"The birds around me hopp'd and play'd: / Their thoughts I cannot measure, / But the least motion which they made, / It seem'd a thrill of pleasure.\"\nD) \"I heard a thousand blended notes, / While in a grove I [sat] reclined, / In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts / Bring sad thoughts to the mind.\"\n\n# 15 \n\nMean Ratings for Patients after 21 Days\n\n| Measure | Mean rating for participants <br> aware of taking a placebo | Mean rating for participants <br> in the control group |\n| :-- | :--: | :--: |\n| Global improvement | 5.0 | 3.9 |\n| Symptom severity reduction | 92.00 | 46.00 |\n| Quality of life improvement | 11.4 | 5.4 |\n\nTo test whether a medication is effective, scientists compare outcomes for patients taking it and patients taking a placebo (a medically inactive substance). Patients normally aren't told they're receiving a placebo, but a research team conducted a study to see if there might be a medical benefit to telling them. The team used various measures to evaluate participants, with higher ratings indicating greater well-being in each measure. Compared to the mean ratings after 21 days for participants in the control group, the mean ratings for participants who were aware of taking a placebo $\\qquad$\nWhich choice most effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement?\nA) ranged from 5.0 to 92.00 , indicating that well-being varied widely from participant to participant.\nB) were lower for two measures, with the rating for only one measure indicating greater well-being for these participants.\nC) ranged from 3.9 to 46.00 , with no rating indicating greater well-being in any measure for these participants.\nD) were higher for all three measures, indicating greater overall well-being for these participants.\n\nAs media consumption has become increasingly multiplatform and socially mediated, active news acquisition has diminished in favor of an attitude known as \"news finds me\" (NFM), in which people passively rely on their social networks and ambient media environments for information about current events. Homero Gil de Zúñiga and Trevor Diehl examined data on a representative group of adults in the United States to determine participants' strength of NFM attitude, political knowledge, and political interest. Although no major election took place sufficiently near the study for Gil de Zúñiga and Diehl to identify causality between NFM and voting behavior, they did posit that NFM may reduce voting probability through an indirect effect.\nWhich finding, if true, would most directly support the idea advanced by Gil de Zúñiga and Diehl?\nA) NFM attitude tends to increase in strength as major elections approach, and people are significantly more likely to vote in major elections than in minor elections.\nB) NFM attitude has a strong negative effect on political knowledge and interest, and there is known to be a strong positive correlation between political knowledge and interest and the likelihood of voting.\nC) Political interest is known to have a strong positive effect on likelihood of voting but shows only a weak positive effect on political knowledge, and NFM attitude shows little correlation with either political knowledge or political interest.\nD) The likelihood of voting increases as political knowledge increases, and the relationship between NFM attitude and political knowledge tends to strengthen as the size of people's social networks increases.\n",

However, a massive study in forest management and preservation spanning 700,000 hectares in Oregon's Malheur National Forest calls that view into question.

Francie, a young girl, visits the library often.\n\nFrancie thought that all the books in the world were in that library and she had a plan about reading all the books in the world. She was reading a book a day in alphabetical order and not skipping the dry ones. She remembered that the first author had been Abbott. She had been reading a book a day for a long time now and she was still in the B's. Already she had read about bees and buffaloes, Bermuda vacations and Byzantine architecture. For all her enthusiasm, she had to admit that some of the B's had been hard going. But Francie was a reader.\n(c) 1947 by Betty Smith\n\nWhich choice best states the main purpose of the text?\nA) To illustrate Francie's enjoyment of an unusual topic\nB) To explain why Francie prefers reading over other activities\nC) To portray Francie's determination to meet a goal\nD) To describe a book that Francie greatly admires\n\n# Module \n\nResearchers have long hypothesized that woolly mammoths were hunted to extinction in North America by humans using spears with grooved tips known as Clovis points. One anthropologist set out to test this hypothesis. Using a mechanical spear-thrower, he launched spears with Clovis points into mounds of clay-substitutes for the animals' large bodies. The projectiles generally penetrated only a few inches into the clay, an amount insufficient to have harmed most woolly mammoths. This led the anthropologist to conclude that hunters using spears with Clovis points likely weren't the principal drivers of the extinction.\n\nWhich choice best states the main purpose of the text?\nA) To argue for the significance of new findings amid an ongoing debate among researchers\nB) To discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the method used in an experiment\nC) To summarize two competing hypotheses and a major finding associated with each one\nD) To describe an experiment whose results cast doubt on an established hypothesis\n\nThe people of medieval Europe have traditionally been seen as uninterested in cleanliness and hygiene, but modern research has shown that this is largely a myth. According to historian Eleanor Janega, most medieval towns in Europe had at least one public bathhouse, which often offered both full-immersion baths and-more affordably-steam baths. While such amenities were available mainly to town dwellers, regular bathing in rivers and streams or daily sponge baths at home were common practices throughout medieval Europe.\n\nWhich choice best describes the function of the underlined portion?\nA) It asserts that in medieval Europe steam baths were more popular in rural areas than in urban ones.\nB) It describes a limitation of earlier historians' studies of medieval European bathing habits.\nC) It concedes that not all people in medieval Europe had access to public bathhouses.\nD) It explains why Janega decided to study the popularity of public bathhouses in medieval Europe.\n\nScholarly accounts of the Chicano movement-a movement that advocated for the social, political, and cultural empowerment of Mexican Americans and reached its zenith in the 1960s and 1970s-tend to focus on the most militant, outspoken figures in the movement, making it seem uniformly radical. Geographer Juan Herrera has shown, however, that if we shift our focus toward the way the movement manifested in comparatively low-profile neighborhood institutions and projects, we see participants espousing an array of political orientations and approaches to community activism.\n\nWhich choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?\nA) It presents a trend in scholarship on the Chicano movement that the text claims has been reevaluated by researchers in light of Herrera's work on the movement's participants.\nB) It identifies an aspect of the Chicano movement that the text implies was overemphasized by scholars due to their own political orientations.\nC) It describes a common approach to studying the Chicano movement that, according to the text, obscures the ideological diversity of the movement's participants.\nD) It summarizes the conventional method for analyzing the Chicano movement, which the text suggests creates a misleading impression of the effectiveness of neighborhood institutions and projects.\n\nElizabeth Asiedu has identified a negative correlation between the share of developing countries' economies derived from natural-resource extraction and those countries' receipts of foreign investment. This may appear counterintuitive-resource extraction requires initial investments (in extractive technology, for instance) at scales best met by multinational corporations-but Asiedu notes that natural-resource industries' boom-bust cycle can destabilize local currencies and increase developing countries' vulnerability to external shocks, creating levels of uncertainty to which foreign investors are typically averse.\nWhich choice best states the main idea of the text?\nA) Although it may seem surprising that foreign investment declines in developing countries as natural-resource extraction makes up a larger share of those countries' economies, that decline happens because resource extraction requires initial investments too large for foreign investors to supply.\nB) Although developing countries tend to become less dependent on foreign investment as natural-resource industries make up a larger share of their economies, this change may not occur if the boom-bust cycle of those industries destabilizes local currencies or increases countries' vulnerability to external shocks.\nC) Although one might expect that foreign investment would increase as natural-resource extraction makes up a larger share of developing countries' economies, the opposite happens because heavy reliance on natural resources can lead to unattractive conditions for investors.\nD) Although foreign investors tend to avoid initial investments in natural-resource industries in developing countries, foreign investment may increase significantly as those industries stabilize and the risks associated with them decline.\n\nTo understand how temperature change affects microorganism-mediated cycling of soil nutrients in alpine ecosystems, Eva Kaštovská et al. collected plant-soil cores in the Tatra Mountains at elevations around 2,100 meters and transplanted them to elevations of $1,700-1,800$ meters, where the mean air temperature was warmer by $2^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. Microorganismmediated nutrient cycling was accelerated in the transplanted cores; crucially, microorganism community composition was unchanged, allowing Kaštovská et al. to attribute the acceleration to temperature-induced increases in microorganism activity.\n\nIt can most reasonably be inferred from the text that the finding about the microorganism community composition was important for which reason?\nA) It provided preliminary evidence that microorganism-mediated nutrient cycling was accelerated in the transplanted cores.\nB) It suggested that temperature-induced changes in microorganism activity may be occurring at increasingly high elevations.\nC) It ruled out a potential alternative explanation for the acceleration in microorganism-mediated nutrient cycling.\nD) It clarified that microorganism activity levels in the plant-soil cores varied depending on which microorganisms comprised the community.\n",

It has since become a tradition for hundreds of dance companies in North America to stage The Nutcracker each year. But the show is stuck in the past, with an old-fashioned story and references, so it should no longer be produced. Ballet needs to create new traditions if it wants to stay relevant to contemporary audiences.\n\n## Text 2\n\nThe Nutcracker is outdated, but it should be kept because it's a holiday favorite and provides substantial income for some dance companies. Although it can be behind the times, there are creative ways to update the show. For example, Debbie Allen successfully modernized the story. Her show Hot Chocolate Nutcracker combines ballet, tap, hip-hop, and other styles, and it has been gaining in popularity since it opened in 2009.\nBased on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1?\nA) By questioning the idea that the story of The Nutcracker is stuck in the past and by rejecting the suggestion that contemporary audiences would enjoy an updated version\nB) By agreeing that contemporary audiences have largely stopped going to see performances of The Nutcracker because it's so old-fashioned\nC) By pointing out that most dance companies could increase their incomes by offering modernized versions of The Nutcracker\nD) By suggesting that dance companies should consider offering revised versions of The Nutcracker instead of completely rejecting the show\n\nTo understand how Paleolithic artists navigated dark caves, archaeologist $\\mathrm{M}^{\\mathrm{a}}$ Ángeles Medina-Alcaide and her team tested different lighting methods in a cave in Spain using replicas of artifacts found in European caves with art. They used three different Paleolithic light sources-torches, animal-fat lamps, and fireplaces-determining that each likely had a specific purpose. For instance, the team learned that the animal-fat lamps were less useful than torches while walking because the lamps didn't illuminate the cave floor.\n\nWhich choice best states the main idea of the text?\nA) Medina-Alcaide and her team's study demonstrated that fireplaces were essential to the creators of Paleolithic cave art.\nB) Medina-Alcaide and her team discovered that Paleolithic cave artists in Spain used animal-fat lamps more often than they used torches.\nC) Medina-Alcaide and her team were reluctant to draw many conclusions from their study because of the difficulty they had replicating light sources based on known artifacts.\nD) Medina-Alcaide and her team tested Paleolithic light sources and learned some details about how Paleolithic artists traveled within dark caves.\n\nAnnual Car Production in the United States, 1910-1925\n\n| Year | Number <br> of cars <br> produced | Number of <br> companies <br> producing cars |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| 1910 | 123,990 | 320 |\n| 1915 | 548,139 | 224 |\n| 1920 | $1,651,625$ | 197 |\n| 1925 | $3,185,881$ | 80 |\n\nA student is using the table as part of a social studies class presentation on the US auto industry in the early twentieth century.

In a study, data scientist Sam K. Hui and colleagues found that this effect can also be achieved with a less obvious cue: rearranging a store's layout. The researchers explain that trying to find items in new locations causes shoppers to move through more of the store, exposing them to more products and increasing the likelihood that they'll buy an item they hadn't planned on purchasing.\n\nWhich response from a survey given to shoppers who made a purchase at a retail store best supports the researchers' explanation?\nA) \"I needed to buy some cleaning supplies, but they weren't in their regular place. While I was looking for them, I saw this interesting notebook and decided to buy it, too.\"\nB) \"I didn't buy everything on my shopping list today. I couldn't find a couple of the items in the store, even though I looked all over for them.\"\nC) \"The store sent me a coupon for a new brand of soup, so I came here to find out what kinds of soup that brand offers.

I came here to buy some things that the other store doesn't always have.\"\n\nThe 2021 exhibition This Is the Day at Arkansas's Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art featured works dealing with expressions of faith and spirituality in the Black community. The museum's 2022 exhibition The Dirty South, meanwhile, focused on Black culture in the American South from 1920 to 2020, with a particular focus on the intersections between visual arts and music. Together, these exhibitions don't merely highlight the diversity of the Black experience in the US; they also showcase the diverse media through which artists have depicted and engaged with that experience.\nWhich statement about the exhibitions, if true, would most directly support the underlined claim?\nA) Between them, This Is the Day and The Dirty South included drawings, paintings, photographs, sculptures, textiles, videos, costumes, and music.\nB) This Is the Day included works by fewer than two dozen artists, whereas The Dirty South included works by more than 80 artists.\nC) This Is the Day exclusively included works in the permanent collection of the museum, whereas The Dirty South included works from multiple sources outside the museum.\nD) Between them, This Is the Day and The Dirty South included works depicting more than 300 years of Black experience in the United States.\n\n[Image removed]\n\nTo investigate potential cognitive benefits of taking leave from work, psychologist Jan Packer and colleagues conducted a six-month study of Australian university staff members who took no leave from work during the study, took 2-4 days of leave, or took 1-5 weeks of leave. Tests of attentiveness were administered to participants three times during the study: at random for the no-leave staff, and for the rest, one week before their leave, one week following their return to work, and one week after the second test administration. After analyzing the results, the researchers concluded that longer leave times might not confer a greater cognitive benefit than shorter leave times do.\n\nWhich choice best describes data from the graph that support the researchers' conclusion?\nA) In the second test administration, participants who took 2-4 days of leave had higher average attentiveness scores than did those who took no leave, but in the third test administration, those who took no leave had higher average scores than those who took 1-5 weeks of leave.\nB) In the first test administration, participants who took 2-4 days of leave had lower average attentiveness scores than did those who took 1-5 weeks of leave and those who took no leave.\nC) In both the second and third test administrations, participants who took 2-4 days of leave had higher average attentiveness scores than did participants who took 1-5 weeks of leave.\nD) In the second and third test administrations, participants who took 2-4 days of leave had higher average attentiveness scores than did those who took no leave.\n\n[Image removed]\n\nIt may seem that the optimal strategy for an animal pursuing prey or escaping predators is to move at maximal speed, but the energy expense of exploiting full speed capacity can disfavor such a strategy even in escape contexts, as evidenced by the fact that\n\nWhich choice most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the text?\nA) most lizard species use about the same percentage of their maximal speed when escaping predation as they do when pursuing prey.\nB) multiple lizard species move at an average of less than $90 \\%$ of their maximal speed while escaping predation.\nC) more lizard species use, on average, $90 \\%-100 \\%$ of their maximal speed while escaping predation than use any other percentage of their maximal speed.\nD) at least 4 lizard species use, on average, less than $100 \\%$ of their maximal speed while pursuing prey.\n\nUnder normal atmospheric pressure at Earth's surface, water molecules form a tetrahedral network stabilized by hydrogen bonds between adjacent molecules. Extreme high pressure, such as can be found in deep ocean waters, destabilizes these bonds and compresses water's structure, allowing water molecules within organisms to permeate proteins and impede crucial biological functions; yet deep-sea organisms known as piezophiles have adapted to extreme pressure. Studies have found a positive correlation between the depths that various piezophiles inhabit and concentrations of a compound called trimethylamine N -oxide (TMAO) in their muscle tissues, which has led a team of researchers to hypothesize that TMAO reduces water's compressibility.\nWhich finding, if true, would most directly support the researchers' hypothesis?\nA) Water molecules are found to be impervious to TMAO even when the water molecules' tetrahedral configuration has been distorted by high pressure.\nB) Examination of TMAO's molecular structure shows that TMAO molecules retain their shape even as pressure increases.\nC) A positive correlation is found between concentrations of TMAO and the rate at which water's molecular structure compresses as pressure increases.\nD) Analysis of water's molecular structure under high pressure reveals that hydrogen bonds are more stable when TMAO is present than when it is not.\n\nThe Cretaceous pterosaur Tupandactylus navigans is known for having an anomalously oversized head crest. Until an almost complete fossil skeleton was found in Brazil, paleontologists had been able to study only skull specimens from T. navigans, though it was presumed that, like other pterosaurs, the species's primary form of locomotion was powered flight. Examining the fuller skeleton in 2016, Victor Beccari and his team determined that T. navigans had long hind legs, short wings, and an unusually long neck-characteristics that, combined with the creature's large-crested head, would have made sustained flight difficult and walking upright relatively comfortable. Based on these findings the team suggests that T. navigans likely $\\qquad$\nWhich choice most logically completes the text?\nA) flew for longer distances than did other pterosaur species that had oversized head crests.\nB) had longer wings than other pterosaur species considered to have been comfortable walking.\nC) had a smaller head than researchers expected based on the earlier T. navigans skull specimens.\nD) flew for shorter distances and spent more time walking than researchers previously thought.\n",

She has installed giant sculptures all over the world. Echelman uses bright and flowing materials, which mimic the wind. However, while her sculptures appear as delicate as a breeze, they are actually very durable.\n\nWhich quotation from an article about Echelman's sculptures, if true, would most effectively illustrate the underlined claim?\nA) \"Echelman uses a special program that makes a 3D model of the sculpture.\"\nB) \"The first part of planning a new sculpture is done using paper and pencil, and then a digital program is used to finalize the design.\"\nC) \"The materials that Echelman uses to build her sculptures are both flexible and strong.\"\nD) \"Each sculpture is designed to reflect local landmarks from the area in which it is eventually installed.\"\n\nEarly Earth is thought to have been characterized by a stagnant lid tectonic regime, in which the upper lithosphere (the outer rocky layer) was essentially immobile and there was no interaction between the lithosphere and the underlying mantle. Researchers investigated the timing of the transition from a stagnant lid regime to a tectonic plate regime, in which the lithosphere is fractured into dynamic plates that in turn allow lithospheric and mantle material to mix. Examining chemical data from lithospheric and mantle-derived rocks ranging from 285 million to 3.8 billion years old, the researchers dated the transition to 3.2 billion years ago.\n\nWhich finding, if true, would most directly support the researchers' conclusion?\nA) Among rocks known to be older than 3.2 billion years, significantly more are mantle derived than lithospheric, but the opposite is true for the rocks younger than 3.2 billion years.\nB) Mantle-derived rocks older than 3.2 billion years show significantly more compositional diversity than lithospheric rocks older than 3.2 billion years do.\nC) There is a positive correlation between the age of lithospheric rocks and their chemical similarity to mantle-derived rocks, and that correlation increases significantly in strength at around 3.2 billion years old.\nD) Mantle-derived rocks younger than 3.2 billion years contain some material that is not found in older mantle-derived rocks but is found in older and contemporaneous lithospheric rocks.\n\nThe Uto-Aztecan language family is divided into a northern branch, which includes the Shoshone language of present-day Idaho and Utah, and a southern one, whose best-known representative is Nahuatl, the language of the Aztec Empire in Mexico. Lexical similarities across the family, including of botanical terms, confirm descent from a single language spoken millennia ago, and the family's geographical distribution suggests an origin in what is now the US Southwest. However, vocabulary pertaining to maize isn't shared between northern and southern branches, despite the crop's universal cultivation among Uto-Aztecan tribes. Given archaeological evidence that maize originated in Mexico and diffused northward into what became the US Southwest, some linguists reason that $\\qquad$\nWhich choice most logically completes the text?\nA) northern Uto-Aztecan tribes likely obtained the crop directly from a southern Uto-Aztecan tribe rather than from a non-Uto-Aztecan tribe.\nB) variation in maize-related vocabulary within each branch of the Uto-Aztecan family likely reflects regionally specific methods for cultivating the crop.\nC) southern Uto-Aztecan tribes likely acquired maize at roughly the same time as northern Uto-Aztecan tribes did, though from different sources.\nD) the family's division into northern and southern branches likely preceded the acquisition of the crop by the Uto-Aztecan tribes.\n",

To characterize the nature of the depositional environment, Frances Rivera-Hernández et al. analyzed the grain size of Murray Formation sediment, finding that although there are intervals of coarse grains, most of the sediment consists of fine grains that show signs of cracking due to episodic desiccation.

To address this problem, chemist Guoliang Liu and colleagues designed a reactor that melts polyethylene and polypropylene-two widely used plastics-into a wax. The wax can then be transformed into a surfactant (a chemical compound usable as a detergent). With this promising new method, plastic waste could be turned into a range of useful cleaning products.\nWhich choice best states the function of the underlined portion of the text?\nA) It clarifies the meaning of a scientific term.\nB) It describes an environmental concern.\nC) It explains the significance of a scientific discovery.\nD) It identifies a result that confused the team.\n\nThe following text is from H.D.'s 1916 poem \"Mid-Day.\" In the poem, the speaker is on a path in an outdoor setting.\n\nA slight wind shakes the seed-pods-\nmy thoughts are spent\nas the black seeds.\nMy thoughts tear me,\nI dread their fever.\nI am scattered in its whirl.\nI am scattered like\nthe hot shrivelled seeds.\nWhich choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?\nA) It illustrates a change in the natural environment that the speaker implies is responsible for the growing misgivings described in the text.\nB) It establishes an example of consistency in the natural landscape that the speaker then contrasts with the unpredictability of human emotions.\nC) It presents an observation of an occurrence in the natural world that the speaker then expands on to convey a sense of a turbulent interior state.\nD) It evokes the ordinariness of an event in nature to suggest that the critical self-evaluation the speaker engages in is a common pursuit.\n\nIn 2023 literary scholar Jeremy Douglass cautioned technology investors and enthusiasts who predict conventional books' ultimate displacement by newer forms of media. Douglass observed that the concept of an \"interactive\" text is much older than technologists assume, extending back to the first time readers scratched notes into a text's margins. In addition, newer media, such as video games, haven't replaced older forms of entertainment, such as comic books, but rather exist alongside them. Douglass believes that rather than supplanting books, technology is simply making new forms of expression possible.\n\nWhich choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?\nA) It challenges the stance of the investors and enthusiasts who are mentioned earlier in the text.\nB) It explains the basis for the claim made by the technologists mentioned in the text.\nC) It suggests that academics are better suited than investors to see the potential uses of contemporary interactive texts.\nD) It provides a historical anecdote about the technological challenges involved in reading the earliest interactive texts.\n\nIn 2018, scientists discovered an immense aggregation of Muusoctopus robustus (pearl octopuses) along a hydrothermal vent 3,200 meters beneath the ocean's surface. Water temperatures at this site-named the Octopus Garden-climb as high as $11^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, much warmer than the ambient $1.6^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ typical at this depth. Based on observations made over three years, scientists concluded that temperatures at the site likely confer reproductive benefits and that the site is used exclusively for reproduction-6,000 M. robustus adults, hatchlings, and eggs were observed at the garden, but no juveniles were present.\n\nWhich statement about M. robustus and the Octopus Garden is best supported by the text?\nA) M. robustus leave the Octopus Garden upon reaching an intermediary stage of development.\nB) The M. robustus population at the Octopus Garden remains stable despite variations in water temperature.\nC) M. robustus nests in the Octopus Garden contain on average fewer but larger eggs than nests at similar ocean depths.\nD) The Octopus Garden provides an ideal feeding ground for M. robustus hatchlings.\n\nThe following text is from Thomas Mann's 1924 novel The Magic Mountain, translated by John E.

(c) 1995 by Alfred A. Knopf, Inc.\n\nWhat does the text most strongly suggest about the story of Hans Castorp?\nA) Though it is true that stories of even the most uninteresting people are themselves interesting because all people are unique, the reason this story is interesting is nonetheless difficult to understand because of the passage of time.\nB) Even though it is a story of a person of no particular importance, its age and the manner in which it therefore must be told are both indicators that the story itself is important.\nC) Like all stories about the lives of inconsequential people, this story must necessarily be related in a particular way if the reason the story is consequential is to be made evident to the audience.\nD) It is a remarkable story that happened to an unremarkable person, though one could plausibly argue that because the story is valuable, some of its value accrues to the person at its center.\n\n12\n[Image removed]\n\nResearcher Judith Hilton and her team interviewed 55 people about which factors would make them switch from using single-use plastic containers to reusable containers.

Aristotle observes that different forms of government can fall in different ways-for example, oligarchies might grant power to military leaders during wartime who refuse to relinquish that power during peacetime-but some methods of preserving order apply across all forms of government. The student claims that in particular Aristotle asserts that in a healthy state obedience to law must be as close to absolute as possible and that even minor infractions should not be ignored.\n\nWhich quotation from a philosopher's analysis of The Politics would best support the student's claim?\nA) \"When constructing his argument regarding the characteristics of a well-functioning government, Aristotle asserts that 'Transgression creeps in unperceived and at last ruins the state,' illustrating this idea with a comparison to frequent small expenditures slowly and almost imperceptibly chipping away at a fortune until it is ultimately depleted.\"\nB) \"When Aristotle writes on the necessity of avoiding corruption in government, he proposes that 'every state should be so administered and so regulated by law that its magistrates cannot possibly make money.' In particular, he thinks oligarchies are particularly susceptible to corruption through bribery.\"\nC) \"When Aristotle considers the health of constitutions, he states that 'Constitutions are preserved when their destroyers are at a distance, and sometimes also because they are near, for the fear of them makes the government keep in hand the constitution.' He holds that rulers who wish to see constitutions preserved must continually remind the populace of the dangers that would result from a constitutional collapse.\"\nD) \"When contrasting different forms of government, Aristotle holds that 'oligarchies may last, not from any inherent stability in such forms of government, but because the rulers are on good terms both with the unenfranchised and with the governing classes.' That is, oligarchic leaders who wish to hold on to power will introduce members of disenfranchised classes into government in a participatory role.\"\n\n# 14 \n\nAlmost all works of fiction contain references to the progression of time, including the time of day when events in a story take place. In a 2020 study, Allen Kim, Charuta Pethe, and Steven Skiena claim that an observable pattern in such references reflects a shift in human behavior prompted by the spread of electric lighting in the late nineteenth century. The researchers drew this conclusion from an analysis of more than 50,000 novels spanning many centuries and cultures, using software to recognize and tally both specific time references-that is, clock phrases, such as 7 a.m. or 2:30 p.m.-and implied ones, such as mentions of meals typically associated with a particular time of day.\nWhich finding from the study, if true, would most directly support the researchers' conclusion?\nA) Novels published after the year 1800 include the clock phrase 10 a.m. less often than novels published before the year 1800 do.\nB) Novels published after 1880 contain significantly more references to activities occurring after 10 p.m. than do novels from earlier periods.\nC) Among novels published in the nineteenth century, implied time references become steadily more common than clock phrases as publication dates approach 1900.\nD) The time references of noon ( 12 p.m.) and midnight ( 12 a.m.) are used with roughly the same frequency in the novels.\n\nPercentage of ULE Attributed to Population Growth and GDP per Capita Growth in Two World Regions\n[Image removed]\n\nRegion, by time period\nurban population growth\nGDP per capita growth\n\nIn a study of urban physical expansion, Richa Mahtta et al. conducted a meta-analysis of more than 300 cities worldwide to determine whether urban land expansion (ULE) was more strongly influenced by urban population growth or by growth in gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, a measure of economic activity. Because efficient national government is necessary to provide urban services and infrastructure that attract economic investment, Mahtta et al. propose that absent other factors, the importance of GDP per capita growth to ULE would likely increase relative to the importance of population growth as governments become more efficient. If true, this suggests the possibility that $\\qquad$\n\nWhich choice most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the statement?\nA) national governments of countries in Region 1 experienced declines in efficiency in the period from 2000 to 2014, relative to the period from 1970 to 2000.\nB) countries in Region 1 experienced a slower rate of economic growth in the period from 2000 to 2014 than countries in Region 2 did, despite increasing national government efficiency in Region 1.\nC) national governments of most countries in Region 2 became more efficient in the period from 2000 to 2014 than they had been in the period from 1970 to 2000, but those of several countries in this region did not.\nD) national governments of countries in Region 1 and in Region 2 generally became more efficient in the period from 2000 to 2014 than they had been in the period from 1970 to 2000, but at different rates.\n\n[Image removed]\n\nA student is researching the Chinese government's 1992 shift to a market economy that emphasizes trade liberalization. One means of trade liberalization involves expanding from ordinary imports into an emphasis on processing imports, which have two types: processing with assembly (in which a firm obtains raw materials from a foreign trading partner without payment and sells the final goods to that partner, charging for assembly) and processing with inputs (in which a firm expends capital to buy raw materials from a trading partner, processes them into final goods, and sells those goods to whichever trading partner it chooses). The student asserts that while initial efforts at trade liberalization were shaped by Chinese firms' limited capital, this situation resolved during the 2000s.\n\nWhich choice best describes data from the graph that support the student's assertion?\nA) Processing imports with inputs were greater than both ordinary imports and processing imports with assembly in 2006.\nB) From 2000 to 2006, processing imports with inputs rose much more sharply than processing imports with assembly did.\nC) From 2000 to 2006, neither processing imports with inputs nor processing imports with assembly were greater than ordinary imports.\nD) Processing imports with assembly were greater in 2006 than processing imports with inputs in 2000.\n\nNarwhals are shy whales that live in the remote Arctic Ocean. Some of them have a long tusk, like a unicorn horn, with sensitive nerves. Narwhals are known for this tusk, but many actually don't have one and its purpose is unknown. One group of scientists came up with a possible purpose in 2014. The scientists suggested that the tusk may help narwhals determine when water around them is likely to start freezing and become dangerous for them.

Testing the thermomechanical properties of several commercially available SiC fibers, Ramakrishna T. Bhatt et al. found that in comparison with two polymer-derived SiC fibers, a nitrogen-treated SiC fiber exhibited a lower minimum creep rate, a measure of the rate at which a stress-exposed material deforms at a constant temperature and uniaxial load. The finding suggests that $\\qquad$\nWhich choice most logically completes the text?\nA) unlike the two polymer-derived SiC fibers, the nitrogen-treated SiC fiber can substantially inhibit creep, provided that temperatures and loads are consistent.\nB) the two polymer-derived SiC fibers likely hold similar potential for reducing the creep resistance of materials exposed to stress and elevated temperatures, thus prolonging the life span of aerospace machinery.\nC) composites based on the two polymer-derived SiC fibers have chemical properties that may improve the mechanical and thermal stability of aerospace equipment to a greater extent than do composites based on the nitrogen-treated SiC fiber.\nD) aerospace composites containing the nitrogen-treated SiC fiber may have the ability to withstand mechanical stress for a longer period of time than can aerospace composites containing either of the two polymer-derived SiC fibers.\n\nOne of the earliest known maps is a Babylonian clay tablet thought to be almost 4,500 years old.

Note \"putatively\": as Gavin Kennedy has shown, Smith deploys this metaphor only once in his economic writings-to make a narrow point about the then-dominant economic theory of mercantilism-and it was largely ignored until some twentieth-century economists eager to secure an intellectual pedigree for their views elevated it to a fully-fledged paradigm.\n\nWhich choice best states the main idea of the text?\nA) Although Smith is famed for his metaphor of the invisible hand, the metaphor was largely ignored until economists in the twentieth century came to realize that the metaphor was a robust model that anticipated their own views.\nB) Some twentieth-century economists gave Smith's metaphor of the invisible hand a significance it does not have in Smith's work, but it is nevertheless a useful model of how individuals produce aggregate benefits by pursuing their own economic interests.\nC) Smith's metaphor of the invisible hand has been interpreted as a model of how individuals acting in their own interest produce aggregate benefits, but it was intended as a subtle critique of the economic theory of mercantilism.\nD) The reputation of Smith's metaphor of the invisible hand is not due to the importance of the metaphor in Smith's work but rather to the promotion of the metaphor by some later economists for their own ends.\n\n# 14 \n\nApproximate Rates of Speech and Information Conveyed for Five Languages\n\n| Language | Rate of speech <br> (syllables <br> per second) | Rate of information <br> conveyed (bits <br> per second) |\n| :-- | :--: | :--: |\n| Serbian | 7.2 | 39.1 |\n| Spanish | 7.7 | 42.0 |\n| Vietnamese | 5.3 | 42.5 |\n| Thai | 4.7 | 33.8 |\n| Hungarian | 5.9 | 34.6 |\n\nA group of researchers working in Europe, Asia, and Oceania conducted a study to determine how quickly different Eurasian languages are typically spoken (in syllables per second) and how much information they can effectively convey (in bits per second). They found that, although languages vary widely in the speed at which they are spoken, the amount of information languages can effectively convey tends to vary much less. Thus, they claim that two languages with very different spoken rates can nonetheless convey the same amount of information in a given amount of time.\n\nWhich choice best describes data from the table that support the researchers' claim?\nA) Among the five languages in the table, Thai and Hungarian have the lowest rates of speech and the lowest rates of information conveyed.\nB) Vietnamese conveys information at approximately the same rate as Spanish despite being spoken at a slower rate.\nC) Among the five languages in the table, the language that is spoken the fastest is also the language that conveys information the fastest.\nD) Serbian and Spanish are spoken at approximately the same rate, but Serbian conveys information faster than Spanish does.\n\nEstimates of Tyrannosaurid Bite Force\n\n| Study | Year | Estimation method | Approximate bite force <br> (newtons) |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :--: |\n| Cost et al. | 2019 | muscular and skeletal modeling | $35,000-63,000$ |\n| Gignac and Erickson | 2017 | tooth-bone interaction analysis | $8,000-34,000$ |\n| Meers | 2002 | body-mass scaling | $183,000-235,000$ |\n| Bates and Falkingham | 2012 | muscular and skeletal modeling | $35,000-57,000$ |\n\nThe largest tyrannosaurids-the family of carnivorous dinosaurs that includes Tarbosaurus, Albertosaurus, and, most famously, Tyrannosaurus rex-are thought to have had the strongest bites of any land animals in Earth's history. Determining the bite force of extinct animals can be difficult, however, and paleontologists Paul Barrett and Emily Rayfield have suggested that an estimate of dinosaur bite force may be significantly influenced by the methodology used in generating that estimate.\n\nWhich choice best describes data from the table that support Barrett and Rayfield's suggestion?\nA) The study by Meers used body-mass scaling and produced the lowest estimated maximum bite force, while the study by Cost et al. used muscular and skeletal modeling and produced the highest estimated maximum.\nB) In their study, Gignac and Erickson used tooth-bone interaction analysis to produce an estimated bite force range with a minimum of 8,000 newtons and a maximum of 34,000 newtons.\nC) The bite force estimates produced by Bates and Falkingham and by Cost et al. were similar to each other, while the estimates produced by Meers and by Gignac and Erickson each differed substantially from any other estimate.\nD) The estimated maximum bite force produced by Cost et al. exceeded the estimated maximum produced by Bates and Falkingham, even though both groups of researchers used the same method to generate their estimates.\n\nPsychologists Dacher Keltner and Jonathan Haidt have argued that experiencing awe-a sensation of reverence and wonder typically brought on by perceiving something grand or powerful-can enable us to feel more connected to others and thereby inspire us to act more altruistically. Keltner, along with Paul K. Piff, Pia Dietze, and colleagues, claims to have found evidence for this effect in a recent study where participants were asked to either gaze up at exceptionally tall trees in a nearby grove (reported to be a universally awe-inspiring experience) or stare at the exterior of a nearby, nondescript building. After one minute, an experimenter deliberately spilled a box of pens nearby.\nWhich finding from the researchers' study, if true, would most strongly support their claim?\nA) Participants who had been looking at the trees helped the experimenter pick up significantly more pens than did participants who had been looking at the building.\nB) Participants who helped the experimenter pick up the pens used a greater number of positive words to describe the trees and the building in a postexperiment survey than did participants who did not help the experimenter.\nC) Participants who did not help the experimenter pick up the pens were significantly more likely to report having experienced a feeling of awe, regardless of whether they looked at the building or the trees.\nD) Participants who had been looking at the building were significantly more likely to notice that the experimenter had dropped the pens than were participants who had been looking at the trees.\n",

It also populates the Polynesian Islands, where evidence confirms that Native Hawaiians and other Indigenous peoples were cultivating the plant centuries before seafaring first occurred over the thousands of miles of ocean separating them from South America. To explain how the sweet potato was first introduced in Polynesia, botanist Pablo Muñoz-Rodríguez and colleagues analyzed the DNA of numerous varieties of the plant, concluding that Polynesian varieties diverged from South American ones over 100,000 years ago. Given that Polynesia was peopled only in the last three thousand years, the team concluded that $\\qquad$\nWhich choice most logically completes the text?\nA) the cultivation of the sweet potato in Polynesia likely predates its cultivation in South America.\nB) Polynesian peoples likely acquired the sweet potato from South American peoples only within the last three thousand years.\nC) human activity likely played no role in the introduction of the sweet potato in Polynesia.\nD) Polynesian sweet potato varieties likely descend from a single South American variety that was domesticated, not wild.\n\nThe morphological novelty of echinoderms-marine invertebrates with radial symmetry, usually starlike, around a central point-impedes comparisons with most other animals, in which bilateral symmetry on an anterior-posterior (head to tail) axis through a trunk is typical. Particularly puzzling are sea stars, thought to have evolved a headless layout from a known bilateral origin. Applying genomic knowledge of Saccoglossus kowalevskii acorn worms (close relatives of sea stars, and thus expected to have similar markers for corresponding anatomical regions) to the body patterning genes of Patiria miniata sea stars, Laurent Formery et al. observed activity only in anterior genes across $P$. miniata's entire body and some posterior genes limited to the edges, suggesting that $\\qquad$\nWhich choice most logically completes the text?\nA) despite the greater prevalence of anterior genes in sea stars' genetic makeup, posterior genes active at the body's perimeter are primarily responsible for the starlike layout that distinguishes sea stars' radial symmetry from that of other echinoderms.\nB) contrary to the belief that they evolved from early ancestors with the bilateral form typical of many other animals, sea stars instead originated with an atypical body layout that was neither bilaterally nor radially symmetrical.\nC) although the two species are closely related, there is only minimal correspondence in the genetic markers for head, tail, and trunk region development in P. miniata sea stars and S. kowalevskii acorn worms.\nD) rather than undergoing changes resulting in the eventual elimination of a head region in their radial body plan, as previously assumed, sea stars' morphology evolved to completely lack a trunk and consist primarily of a head region.\n\nTo survive when water is scarce, embryos inside African turquoise killifish eggs $\\qquad$ a dormant state known as diapause.

According to conventional wisdom, one species should emerge after outcompeting the rest. So why do so many species remain? Ecologists' many efforts to explain this phenomenon still haven't uncovered a satisfactory explanation.\n\n## Text 2\n\nEcologist Michael Behrenfeld and colleagues have connected phytoplankton's diversity to their microscopic size. Because these organisms are so tiny, they are spaced relatively far apart from each other in ocean water and, moreover, experience that water as a relatively dense substance. This in turn makes it hard for them to move around and interact with one another. Therefore, says Behrenfeld's team, direct competition among phytoplankton probably happens much less than previously thought.\nBased on the texts, how would Behrenfeld and colleagues (Text 2) most likely respond to the \"conventional wisdom\" discussed in Text 1?\nA) By arguing that it is based on a misconception about phytoplankton species competing with one another\nB) By asserting that it fails to recognize that routine replenishment of ocean nutrients prevents competition between phytoplankton species\nC) By suggesting that their own findings help clarify how phytoplankton species are able to compete with larger organisms\nD) By recommending that more ecologists focus their research on how competition among phytoplankton species is increased with water density\n\nThe following text is adapted from Sylvia Acevedo's 2018 memoir Path to the Stars: My Journey from Girl Scout to Rocket Scientist. The narrator is traveling by car with her family to Mexico City. Mario and Laura are her brother and sister.\n\nMario and I played games to see how many different license plates we could spot, and Laura liked to look for children in the back seats of the cars we passed. We were used to the forty-fiveminute drive to El Paso and familiar with the six-hour ride to Chihuahua, but I wondered what the long journey to Mexico City would be like.\n(c)2018 by Sylvia Acevedo\n\nAccording to the text, what did the narrator and Mario do while riding in the car?\nA) They read books.\nB) They sang songs.\nC) They went to sleep.\nD) They played games.\n\nIn the 1700s and 1800s, European composers experimented with volume in their musical works. They did so by increasing the number of musicians playing in the orchestra. For example, in some of his operas, German composer Richard Wagner added more horns, trombones, and tubas to the orchestra. With more instruments playing at the same time, the orchestra could play extremely loudly at key moments in his operas.\n\nAccording to the text, how did Richard Wagner achieve moments of extremely high volume in his operas?\nA) By moving the performances of his operas from outdoor stages to indoor ones\nB) By increasing the number of musicians playing horns, trombones, and tubas in the orchestra\nC) By building a concert hall whose shape would cause sounds to echo\nD) By insisting that the singers undergo special training to sing for extended periods of time\n\nPoetry in Classical Nahuatl, the language of the Aztec Empire, relies on difrasismo, or a parallel noun construction that conventionally operates as a single metaphor. For example, the common difrasismo in cuauhtli in ocelotl (literally, \"the eagle, the jaguar\") signifies \"warrior.\" The device's function is both formal—providing structure to lines of verse-and ritual: semantic relations among the two nouns and the concept they signify can be tenuous, as in the previous example, such that difrasismos are often only intelligible according to the conceptual associations observed in Aztec ceremonial culture.\n\nWhich statement about the difrasismo in cuauhtli in ocelotl is most strongly supported by the text?\nA) Its metaphorical significance derives from the semantic equivalence of the two nouns constituting the difrasismo.\nB) Its unintelligibility may cause its formal function within a line of verse to go unnoticed by present-day readers.\nC) Its apparent obscurity can be resolved when considered in the proper cultural context.\nD) Its frequency in Classical Nahuatl poetry confirms its intelligibility to the Aztec audience.\n",

Spelman College biologist Mentewab Ayalew and her colleagues hypothesized that plants' response to kanamycin exposure involves altering their uptake of metals, such as iron and zinc. The researchers grew two groups of seedlings of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, half of which were exposed to kanamycin and half of which were a control group without exposure to kanamycin, and measured the plants' metal content five days after germination.\n\nWhich choice best describes data in the graph that support Ayalew and her colleagues' hypothesis?\nA) The control plants contained higher levels of zinc than iron, but plants exposed to kanamycin contained higher levels of iron than zinc.\nB) Both groups of plants contained more than 200 parts per million of both iron and zinc.\nC) Zinc levels were around 300 parts per million in the control plants but nearly 400 parts per million in the plants exposed to kanamycin.\nD) The plants exposed to kanamycin showed lower levels of iron and zinc than the control plants did.\n\nAverage Number and Duration of Torpor Bouts and Arousal Episodes for Alaska Marmots and Arctic Ground Squirrels, 2008-2011\n\n| Feature | Alaska marmots | Arctic ground <br> squirrels |\n| :-- | :--: | :--: |\n| torpor bouts | 12 | 10.5 |\n| duration per bout | 13.81 days | 16.77 days |\n| arousal episodes | 11 | 9.5 |\n| duration per episode | 21.2 hours | 14.2 hours |\n\nWhen hibernating, Alaska marmots and Arctic ground squirrels enter a state called torpor, which minimizes the energy their bodies need to function. Often a hibernating animal will temporarily come out of torpor (called an arousal episode) and its metabolic rate will rise, burning more of the precious energy the animal needs to survive the winter. Alaska marmots hibernate in groups and therefore burn less energy keeping warm during these episodes than they would if they were alone. A researcher hypothesized that because Arctic ground squirrels hibernate alone, they would likely exhibit longer bouts of torpor and shorter arousal episodes than Alaska marmots.\n\nWhich choice best describes data from the table that support the researcher's hypothesis?\nA) The Alaska marmots' arousal episodes lasted for days, while the Arctic ground squirrels' arousal episodes lasted less than a day.\nB) The Alaska marmots and the Arctic ground squirrels both maintained torpor for several consecutive days per bout, on average.\nC) The Alaska marmots had shorter torpor bouts and longer arousal episodes than the Arctic ground squirrels did.\nD) The Alaska marmots had more torpor bouts than arousal episodes, but their arousal episodes were much shorter than their torpor bouts.\n\n[Image removed]\n\nHoneybee hives consist mainly of hexagonal (six-sided) units called cells, in which queens lay eggs. Hexagonal cells for eggs that develop into nonreproductive workers are smaller than those for eggs that develop into reproductive drones, though the size difference varies by species. Difference in cell size results in a construction problem-it's hard to neatly connect sections of small cells to sections of large cells-that worsens as the difference increases. To fill in gaps between the sections when building a hive, bees rely on cells that have more or fewer than six sides. A student studying beehive structure consults data on three species, concluding that $\\qquad$\n\nWhich choice most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the student's conclusion?\nA) cells for worker eggs are probably closer in size to cells for drone eggs in the hives of the western honeybee than in the hives of the dwarf honeybee and the black dwarf honeybee.\nB) both the western honeybee and the black dwarf honeybee probably reserve eight-sided cells for drone eggs, while the dwarf honeybee likely deposits drone eggs in seven-sided cells.\nC) the western honeybee probably relies on many more geometrical shapes when constructing cells than either the dwarf honeybee or the black dwarf honeybee does.\nD) the percentage of hexagonal cells is probably slightly lower in the hives of the western honeybee than in the hives of the dwarf honeybee and the black dwarf honeybee.\n\nALSOL is a microcredit program in Mexico that makes small loans to female entrepreneurs who lack the collateral and credit history to secure financing from conventional banks. Borrowers use their business proceeds to repay loans in equal weekly installments and incur no penalty for missed payments other than lack of access to larger loans. Economists Gustavo Barboza and Sandra Trejos analyzed ALSOL data and found that rural borrowers, who mostly make and sell handicrafts, miss payments more often than urban borrowers do, partly because they sell their goods less frequently than they could. Barboza and Trejos claim that this behavior reflects strategic decisions that enable rural women to increase their profits per unit sold.\n\nWhich finding, if true, would most directly support Barboza and Trejos's claim?\nA) Many marketplaces require entrepreneurs to pay marketplace operators a fixed percentage of each day's proceeds in exchange for permission to sell goods there.\nB) Rural entrepreneurs can typically sell their goods for higher prices in cities than in their home areas, but the number of people selling competing goods tends to be higher in cities.\nC) Due to the lower costs they incur, rural entrepreneurs tend to require smaller initial loans than urban entrepreneurs do.\nD) The cost to rural entrepreneurs to bring their goods to towns with marketplaces is high but largely independent of the number of goods they bring.\n",

In the story, Mrs. Spring Fragrance, a Chinese immigrant living in Seattle, is traveling in California. In letters to her husband and friend, she demonstrates her concern for what's happening at her home in Seattle while she is away:\n\nWhich quotation from Mrs. Spring Fragrance's letters most effectively illustrates the claim?\nA) \"My honorable cousin is preparing for the Fifth Moon Festival, and wishes me to compound for the occasion some American 'fudge,' for which delectable sweet, made by my clumsy hands, you have sometimes shown a slight prejudice.\"\nB) \"Next week I accompany Ah Oi to the beauteous town of San José.

Near Vancouver Island in Canada, the otter population is large and well established, yet the eelgrass meadows are healthier than those found elsewhere off Canada's coast. To explain this, conservation scientist Erin Foster and colleagues compared the Vancouver Island meadows to meadows where otters are absent or were reintroduced only recently. Finding that the Vancouver Island meadows have a more diverse gene pool than the others do, Foster hypothesized that damage to eelgrass roots increases the plant's rate of sexual reproduction; this, in turn, boosts genetic diversity, which benefits the meadows' health overall.\n\nWhich finding, if true, would most directly undermine Foster's hypothesis?\nA) At some sites in the study, eelgrass meadows are found near otter populations that are small and have only recently been reintroduced.\nB) At several sites not included in the study, there are large, well-established sea otter populations but no eelgrass meadows.\nC) At several sites not included in the study, eelgrass meadows' health correlates negatively with the length of residence and size of otter populations.\nD) At some sites in the study, the health of plants unrelated to eelgrass correlates negatively with the length of residence and size of otter populations.\n",

Scholars such as Aurelio Espinosa claimed that Mexican American folklore derived largely from the folklore of Spain, which ruled Mexico and what is now the southwestern United States from the sixteenth to early nineteenth centuries. Scholars such as Américo Paredes, by contrast, argued that while some Spanish influence is undeniable, Mexican American folklore is mainly the product of the ongoing interactions of various cultures in Mexico and the United States.\n\nWhich finding, if true, would most directly support Paredes's argument?\nA) The folklore that the ethnographers collected included several songs written in the form of a décima, a type of poem originating in late sixteenth-century Spain.\nB) Much of the folklore that the ethnographers collected had similar elements from region to region.\nC) Most of the folklore that the ethnographers collected was previously unknown to scholars.\nD) Most of the folklore that the ethnographers collected consisted of corridos-ballads about history and social life-of a clearly recent origin.\n\nAmong social animals that care for their young, such as chickens, macaque monkeys, and humans, newborns appear to show an innate attraction to faces and face-like stimuli. Elisabetta Versace and her colleagues used an image of three black dots arranged in the shape of eyes and a nose or mouth to test whether this trait also occurs in Testudo tortoises, which live alone and do not engage in parental care. They found that tortoise hatchlings showed a significant preference for the image, suggesting that $\\qquad$\nWhich choice most logically completes the text?\nA) face-like stimuli are likely perceived as harmless by newborns of social species that practice parental care but as threatening by newborns of solitary species without parental care.\nB) researchers should not assume that an innate attraction to face-like stimuli is necessarily an adaptation related to social interaction or parental care.\nC) researchers can assume that the attraction to face-like stimuli that is seen in social species that practice parental care is learned rather than innate.\nD) newly hatched Testudo tortoises show a stronger preference for face-like stimuli than adult Testudo tortoises do.\n\n18\nAptamers-synthetic DNA or RNA molecules that bind to target molecules-can be used to test for foodborne bacterial pathogens, though their specificity (the probability of returning a negative result in the absence of the focal pathogen) in real-world foods has been unclear.

Economist Ying Fan investigated this notion in the context of the United States newspaper market. She modeled a hypothetical merger of Minneapolis-area newspapers and found that subscription prices would rise following a merger.\n\n## Text 2\n\nEconomists Dario Focarelli and Fabio Panetta have argued that research on the effect of mergers on prices has focused excessively on short-term effects, which tend to be adverse for consumers. Using the case of consumer banking in Italy, they show that over the long term (several years, in their study), the efficiency gains realized by merged companies do result in economic benefits for consumers.\nBased on the texts, how would Focarelli and Panetta (Text 2) most likely respond to Fan's findings (Text 1)?\nA) They would recommend that Fan compare the near-term effect of a merger on subscription prices in the Minneapolis area with the effect of a merger in another newspaper market.\nB) They would argue that over the long term the expenses incurred by the merged newspaper company will also increase.\nC) They would encourage Fan to investigate whether the projected effect on subscription prices persists over an extended period.\nD) They would claim that mergers have a different effect on consumer prices in the newspaper industry than in most other industries.\n\nUtah is home to Pando, a colony of about 47,000 quaking aspen trees that all share a single root system. Pando is one of the largest single organisms by mass on Earth, but ecologists are worried that its growth is declining in part because of grazing by animals. The ecologists say that strong fences could prevent deer from eating young trees and help Pando start thriving again.\n\nAccording to the text, why are ecologists worried about Pando?\nA) It isn't growing at the same rate it used to.\nB) It isn't producing young trees anymore.\nC) It can't grow into new areas because it is blocked by fences.\nD) Its root system can't support many more new trees.\n",
