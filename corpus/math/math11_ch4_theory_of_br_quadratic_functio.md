# Chapter 4: Theory of <br> Quadratic Functions

## INTRODUCTION

This unit explores methods to find the maximum and minimum values of quadratic functions using completing the square and graphical analysis. It also covers the inverse of quadratic functions, determining their domain and range. Additionally, students will learn to solve absolute value quadratic equations and inequalities, as well as equations of rational, radical and exponential forms that can be reduced to quadratic equations. Finally, the unit demonstrates the practical applications of quadratic equations and inequalities in solving real-world problems, providing a strong foundation for problemsolving and analysis.

### 3.1 Quadratic Function

A quadratic function is a polynomial function of degree two. It is typically expressed in the standard form:

$$
f(x)=a x^{2}+b x+c
$$

where $a, b$ and $c$ are real numbers, and $a \neq 0$.

### 3.1.1 Analyzing Quadratic Fyaction by Sketching

As we know shape of the graph of a quadratic function $f(x)=a x^{2}+b x+c$ is a parabola. The parabola opens upward or downward, depending on the sign of the leading coefficient $a$, as shown in the given figure.
The tip of the parabola, labeled as $V$ in the diagrams above, is known as the vertex having coordinates $(h, k)$. The vertical line passing through the vertex serves as the axis of symmetry for the parabola. The vertex represents a turning point, where the graph changes direction.

- If $a>0$, then the vertex is a minimum point.
- If $a<0$, then the vertex is a maximum point.

For sketching the quadratic function, we need to find the $x$-intercept, $y$-intercept and the vertex. For analyzing the sketch of quadratic function, we find whether the vertex is a minimum or a maximum point and indicate the intervals where the function is increasing or decreasing.

Example 1 Sketch and analyze $y=-x^{2}-2 x+3$.
Solution $y=-x^{2}-2 x+3$
The $y$-intercept is $y=-(0)^{2}-2(0)+3=3$
The $x$-intercepts are found by solving the equation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
-x^{2}-2 x+3 & =0 \text { or } x^{2}+2 x-3=0 \\
x^{2}+3 x-x-3 & =0 \\
x(x+3)-1(x+3) & =0 \\
(x+3)(x-1) & =0 \\
x+3=0, x-1 & =0 \\
x & =-3, x=1
\end{aligned}
$$

Now, we find the vertex

$$
h=\frac{-b}{2 a}=-\frac{(-2)}{2(-1)}=-1
$$

$k=-(-1)^{2}-2(-1)+3=-1+2+3=4$
So, the vertex $(-1,4)$ is a maximum point. The function $y$ is increasing on $(-\infty,-1)$ and decreasing on $(-1, \infty)$.
