# Chapter 11: 5.1 CLASSIFICATION OF SOLIDS

## Crystalline Solids

In crystalline solids, there is a regular arrangement of atoms and molecules. The neighbours of every molecule are arranged in a regular pattern that is consistent throughout the crystal. There is, thus, an ordered structure in crystalline solids. Most solids, like metals and ceramics have a crystalline structure. This means their atoms, molecules or ions are arranged in a regular pattern. The arrangement of molecules, atoms or ions within all types of crystalline solids can be studied using various techniques such as X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). It should be noted that atoms, molecules or ions in a crystalline solid are not static. For example, each atom in a crystal vibrates about a fixed point with an amplitude that increases with rise in temperature. It is the average atomic positions which are perfectly ordered over large distances.
The cohesive forces between atoms, molecules or ions in crystalline solids maintain the strict long-range order inspite of atomic vibrations. For every crystal, however, there is a temperature at which the vibrations become greater that the structure suddenly breaks up, and the solid melts. The transition from solid (order) to liquid (disorder) is, therefore, abrupt or discontinuous. Every crystalline solid has a definite melting point e.g., Quartz, Calcite, Sugar, Mica, diamond, etc.

## Amorphous or Glassy Solids

The word amorphous means without form or structure. Thus, in amorphous solids there is no regular arrangement of molecules like that in crystalline solids. We can, therefore, say that amorphous solids are more like liquids with the disordered structure frozen in.
For example, ordinary glass, which is a solid at ordinary temperature, has no regular arrangement of molecules. On heating, it gradually softens into a paste like state before it becomes a very viscous liquid at almost $800^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Thus, amorphous solids are also called glassy solids. This type of solids has no definite melting point e.g., plastic, glass, fused silicon, etc.

## Polymeric Solids

Polymers are solid materials with a structure that is intermediate between order and disorder. They can be classified as partially or poorly crystalline solids.

Polymers form a large group of naturally occurring and synthetic materials. Plastics and synthetic rubbers are termed as polymers because they are formed by polymerization reactions in which relatively simple molecules are chemically combined into massive long chain molecules, or three-dimensional structures. These materials have rather low specific gravity compared with even the lightest of metals, and yet exhibit good strength to weight ratio.
Polymers consist wholly or in part of chemical combinations of carbon with oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen and other metallic or non metallic elements. Polythene, polystyrene and nylon, etc. are examples of polymers. Natural rubber is composed in the pure state entirely of a hydrocarbon with the formula $\left(\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5}\right)_{n}$.
