## Learning Objectives

After studying this chapter, the students will be able to:

- Derive the formula for kinetic energy [using the equations of motion]
- Derive an expression for absolute potential energy of a body at a certain position in the gravitational field [including escape velocity]
- Deduce the work done from force-displacement graph.
- Differentiate between conservative and non-conservative forces.
- State and use the work - energy theorem in a resistive medium to solve problems.

Work is often thought in terms of physical or mental effort. In Physics, however, the termwork involves two things (i) force, and (ii) displacement. We shall begin with a simple situation in which work is done by a constant force.

### 4.1 WORK DONE BY A CONSTANT FORCE

Let us consider an object which is being pulled by a constant force $F$. The force displaces the object through a displacement $d$ in the direction of force. In such a case, work $W$ is defined as the product of the magnitude of the force $F$ and magnitude of the displacement d. This can be written as:

$$
W=F d
$$

Equation (4.1) shows that if the displacement is zero, no work is done even if a large force is applied. For example, pushing on a wall may tire your muscles, but work done is zero as shown in Fig. 4.1.
The force applied on a body may not always be in the direction of force as shown in Fig. (4.2). If the force $F$ makes an angle 0 with the displacement $d$ (Fig. 4.3), the work done is equal to the product of the component of force along the direction of the displacement and the magnitude of displacement. Then
Fig. 4.2

From the definition of work, we find that:
(i) Work is a scalar quantity.
(ii) If $\theta<90^{\circ}$, work is done and it is said to be positive work.
(iii) If $\theta=90^{\circ}$, no work is done.
(iv) If $\theta>90^{\circ}$, the work done is said to be negative.
(v) Sl unit of work is N m , also known as joule (J).

# 4.2 WORKDONE BYAVARIABLEFORCE

In many cases, the force does not remain constant during the process of doing work. For example, as a rocket moves away from the Earth, work is done against the force of gravity, which varies as the inverse square of the distance from the Earth's centre. Similarly, the force exerted by a spring increases with the amount of stretch. How can we calculate the work done in such situations?

Figure 4.5 shows the path of a particle in the $x y$ plane as it moves from point $P$ to point $Q$. The path has been divided into $n$ short intervals of displacements $\Delta d_{1}, \Delta d_{2}, \ldots \ldots, \Delta d_{n}$ and $F_{1}, F_{2}, \ldots \ldots, F_{n}$ are the forces acting during these intervals, respectively.

During each small interval, the force is supposed to be approximately constant. So, the work done for the first interval can then be written as
$\Delta W_{1}=\mathbf{F}_{1} \cdot \Delta \mathbf{d}_{1}=F_{1} \cos \theta_{1} \Delta d_{1}$
and in the second interval
$\Delta W_{2}=F_{2} \cdot \Delta d_{2}=F_{2} \cos \theta_{2} \Delta d_{2}$
and so on. The total work done in moving the object can be calculated by adding all these terms.

$$
\begin{aligned}
W_{\text {total }} & =\Delta W_{1}+\Delta W_{2}+\ldots \ldots+\Delta W_{n} \\
& =F_{1} \cos \theta_{1} \Delta d_{1}+F_{2} \cos \theta_{2} \Delta d_{2}+\ldots \ldots+F_{n} \cos \theta_{n} \Delta d_{n} \\
\text { or } \quad W_{\text {total }} & =\sum_{i=1}^{n} F_{i} \cos \theta_{i} \Delta d_{i}
\end{aligned}
$$

We can examine this graphically by plotting $F \cos \theta$ verses $d$ as shown in Fig. 4.6. The displacement $d$ has been sub-divided into the same $n$ equal Intervals. The value of $F \cos \theta$ at the beginning of each interval is indicated in the figure.
Fig. 4.5
A particle acted upon by a variable force, moves along the path shown from point $P$ to point $Q$.
Fig. 4.6

Now the $i^{\text {th }}$ shaded rectangle has an area $F_{i} \cos \theta_{i} \Delta d$ which is the work done during the $i^{\text {th }}$ interval. Thus, the work done given by Eq. 4.4 equals the sum of the areas of all the rectangles. If we sub-divide the distance into a large number of intervals so that each $\Delta d$ becomes very small, the work done given by Eq. 4.4 becomes more accurate. If we let each $\Delta d$ to approach zero, then we obtain an exact result for the work done, such as:

$$
W_{\text {total }}=\underset{\Delta d \rightarrow 0}{\text { Limit }} \sum_{i=1}^{n} F_{i} \cos \theta_{i} \Delta d_{i}
$$

If this limit $\Delta d$ approaches zero, the total area of all the rectangles (Fig. 4.6) approaches the area between the $F \cos \theta$ verses $d$ curve and $x$-axis from P to Q as shown shaded in Fig. 4.7.
Thus, the work done by a variable force in moving a particle between two points is equal to the area under the $F \cos \theta$ verses $d$ curve between the two points $P$ and $Q$ as shown in Fig. 4.7.

Example 4.3 A force $F$ acting on an object varies with distance $d$ as shown in Fig. 4.8. Calculate the work done by the force as the object moves from $d=0$ to $d=6 \mathrm{~m}$.
Solution The work done by the force is equal to the total area under the curve from $d=0$ to $d=6 \mathrm{~m}$. This area is equal to the area of the rectangular section from $d=0$ to

$d=4 \mathrm{~m}$, plus the area of triangular section from $d=4 \mathrm{~m}$ to $d=6 \mathrm{~m}$.

Hence
Work done represented by the area of rectangle $=4 \mathrm{~m} \times 5 \mathrm{~N}$
$=20 \mathrm{Nm}=20 \mathrm{~J}$
Work done represented by the area of triangle $=\frac{1}{2} \times 2 \mathrm{~m} \times 5 \mathrm{~N}$
$=5 \mathrm{Nm}=5 \mathrm{~J}$
Therefore, the total work done
$=20 \mathrm{~J}+5 \mathrm{~J}=25 \mathrm{~J}$
