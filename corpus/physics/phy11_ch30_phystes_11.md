building blocks of matter.
When a nucleus is smashed in an ultra high energy particle accelerator, or two high energy particles are collided, entirely new types of particles are created which apparently do not exist within the atoms of the ordinary matter. They are the outcome of the violent collisions needed to probe the basic structure of matter. More than a hundred new particles have been identified to be classified into families with similar properties. Many of these were accounted well with the scheme of theoretical physicist while the rest were named "strange particle". They are always created in pairs, e.g., when a pion ( $\pi$ ) collides with a proton, two strange particles $k^{\circ}$ (Kaon), and $\Lambda^{\circ}$ (Lamda) are created. The nuclear reaction is:

$$
\pi^{\prime}+\mathrm{p} \rightarrow \mathrm{k}^{\circ}+\Lambda^{\circ}
$$

All particles spin on their axes and the spin of charged particles makes them tiny magnets. The characteristic spin of electrons, protons, neutrons is $1 / 2$ and the spin of photon is 1 and of pions is taken as zero. Half spin particles obey the Pauli's exclusion principle which says that only one particle of a kind occupies a given quantum state. These particles are called "fermions". The particles with zero or whole number spin do not obey this principle. They are called "bosons", as they obey Bose-Einstein statistics. Further major classifications are:

1. The nucleons and the heavier particles such as $\Lambda^{\circ}$ and $k^{\circ}$ which decay to nucleons are called "baryons" (heavy).
2. The particles that do not interact strongly with nucleons, and are called leptons (small) along with the electrons, lau and neutrino.
Both of the $\beta$-decay (beta-minus and beta-plus) processes provide evidence that the protons and neutrons are not the fundamental particles. By the 1960s many new types of particles similar to the neutron and proton were discovered, as well as many "midsized" particles called mesons whose masses were mostly less than nucleon masses but more than the electron mass (other mesons, found later, have masses greater than nucleons). The strongly attractive particles are called $\pi$ meson or pions while the weakly interacting particles were named $\mu$ mesons or muons.
This discovery led to the conclusion that these particles could not be fundamental particles, and must be made up of even smaller constituents, which were given the name quarks.

## Hadrons and Leptons

Particles can also be classified based on the four fundamental forces that act on them. While the gravitational force affects all particles. Its impact at the subatomic level is so minimal that it is generally disregarded at the sub-atomic level. The electromagnetic force, which acts on all electrically charged particles, is well understood and can be considered when necessary; however, in this chapter, we will largely ignore its effects.
Particles can be broadly classified based on whether they interact via the strong force or

do not. Those that experience the strong force are known as hadrons, while those that do not, are called leptons. Examples of hadrons include protons, neutrons, and pions, whereas electrons and neutrinos are classified as leptons.
Hadrons are composite subatomic particles that can be further divided into two broad categories: some are bosons, referred to as mesons such as pion, while others are fermions, known as baryons, with protons and neutrons being the key examples. Baryons are made of an odd number of quarks (usually three quarks), and mesons are made up of an even number of quarks (usually two quarks: one quark and one antiquark).
The leptons interact only through weak or electromagnetic interactions. No experiments have yet been able to reveal any internal structure for the leptons; they appear to be truly fundamental particles that cannot be split into smaller particles. All known leptons have spin $1 / 2$, so they all are fermions. The six known leptons are grouped as three pairs of particles as shown in Table 12.3. Each pair includes a charged particle $\left(e, \mu^{\prime}, \tau^{\prime}\right)$, its associated neutrino and corresponding anti-particles. Charged leptons can combine with other particles to form various composite particles such as atoms and positronium, while neutrinos rarely interact with anything, and are consequently rarely observed. The best-known of all leptons is the electron.

# 12.6 QUARKS

In 1964, M. Gell-Mann and George Zweig proposed that none of the hadrons, not even the proton and neutron, are truly fundamental, but instead are made up of combinations of three more fundamental entities called quarks or quark flavours. Quarks are considered to be truly fundamental particles, like leptons. Three quarks originally proposed were named up, down, and strange, with abbreviations $\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{d}$ and $\mathbf{s}$, respectively. Presently, we are aware of six quarks, just as there are six leptons-based on a presumed symmetry in nature. The other three quarks are called charm, bottom, and top ( $\mathbf{c}, \mathbf{b}, \mathbf{t}$ ). These new quarks can be distinguished from the 3 original quarks (Table 12.4). All quarks have a spin and an electric charge (a fraction of the previously thought smallest charge eon an electron). Quarks are invisible. They never appear on their own.

All hadrons are considered to be made up of combinations of quarks (plus the gluons that hold them together), and their properties are described by looking at their quark content. Mesons consist of a quark-antiquark pair. For example, $a \pi^{\circ}$ meson is a ud combination. $A \pi^{\circ}$ can be made of uü).
Each baryon, on the other hand, consists of three quarks, such as:
The proton has a quark composition of uud and so its charge quantum number is:
$q($ uud $)=\frac{2}{3}+\frac{2}{3}+\left(-\frac{1}{3}\right)=+1$
Neutron has a quark composition of udd and Its charge quantum number is:
$q($ udd $)=\frac{2}{3}+\left(-\frac{1}{3}\right)+(-\frac{1}{3})=0$

| Table 12.4: Quark flavours |  |  |  |  |  |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Particles | Symbol | Charge <br> (q) | Mass <br> (MeV/ $\mathrm{E}^{\prime}$ ) | Antl. <br> Particle | Charge <br> (q) |
| Up | u | $+\frac{2}{3}$ | 5 |  | $-\frac{2}{3}$ |
| Down | d | $-\frac{1}{3}$ | 10 | $\frac{-}{d}$ | $+\frac{1}{3}$ |
| Charm | c | $+\frac{2}{3}$ | 1600 | c | $-\frac{2}{3}$ |
| Strange | s | $-\frac{1}{3}$ | 200 | $\frac{2}{3}$ | $+\frac{1}{3}$ |
| Top | t | $+\frac{2}{3}$ | 175000 | t | $-\frac{2}{3}$ |
| Bottom | b | $-\frac{1}{3}$ | 4300 | b | $+\frac{1}{3}$ |

Mesons are quark-antiquark pairs. Consider the meson $\pi^{\circ}$, which consists of an upquark u and an antidown quark d. We see that the charge quantum number of the up quark is $+2 / 3$ and that of the antidown quark is $+1 / 3$. This edda nicely to a charge quantum number of +1 for the $n^{\circ}$ meson; that is, $q(u)=2 / 3+1 / 3=+1$.

Not long after the quark theory was proposed, it was suggested that quarks have another property (or quality) called colour, or "colour charge" (analogous to electric charge). According to this theory, each flavour of quark can have one of three colours, usually designated red, green, and blue. Note that the names "colour" and "flavour" have nothing to do with our senses, but are purely whimsical-as are other names, such as charm, in this new field. The anti-quarks are coloured antired, antigreen, and antiblue. Baryons are made up of three quarks, one of each colour. Mesons consist of a quark-anti-quark pair
Fig. 12.7 (a): Colourless baryons: blue + red + green $=$ white

Anti-proton
Fig. 12.7 (b): A colourless anti-baryons: anti-blue + anti-red + anti-green = white

of a particular colour and its anti-colour. Both baryons and mesons are thus colourless or white. Each quark is assumed to carry a colour charge, analogous to an electric charge, and the strong force between quarks is referred to as the colour force. This theory of the strong force is called quantum chromodynamics or QCD, to indicate that the force acts between colour charges (and not between, say, electric charges). The strong force between two hadrons is considered to be a force between the quarks that make them up.

# Beta Decay in Terms of Quarks

When a neutron in the nucleus decays into a proton and an electron (beta particle), an anti-neutrino is also produced in the reaction and the decay process is given as:

$$
{ }_{n}^{1} n \rightarrow{ }_{1}^{1} p+{ }_{1}^{2} e+\bar{v}
$$

Now, we can identify that a neutron with composition udd can convert into a proton with composition uud by changing a down quark into an up quark. The fundamental decay process can now be expressed as:

$$
d \rightarrow u+{ }_{1}^{2} e+\bar{v}
$$

Thus, as our understanding of the fundamental nature of matter deepens, we can analyze familiar processes at increasingly intricate levels. The quark model not only enhances our comprehension of particle structures but also provides insight into their interactions.

### 12.7 HIGGS BOSON

Fundamental particles are considered to be the six quarks, the six leptons and the gauge bosons (Higgs bosons), which are the carriers of the fundamental forces. Leptons and quarks interact with each other by sending and receiving bosons. For example, electromagnetic interactions occur when two positively charged particles send and receive (exchange) photons. The photons are said to "carry" the force between charged particles. Likewise, attraction between two quarks in an atomic nucleus occurs when two quarks send and receive gluons. Similarly, the $\mathrm{W}^{\prime}, \mathrm{W}$ and Z are the bosons that are the carriers of weak nuclear force and gravitons are the carriers of gravitational force. The Higgs boson is a special particle discovered in 2012 at large hadron collider at CERN. It is associated with the Higg's field that permeates all of the space. Its crucial role is that it provides explanation for how the other particles get mass by interacting with it.
The particles that interact strongly with Higg's field get more mass such as carriers of electroweak interaction i.e., $\mathrm{W}^{\prime}, \mathrm{W}$ and Z bosons whereas the particles like photons do not interact with Higg's field and hence, their rest mass is considered zero. Higgs boson has a mass of around 125 giga-electron-volts ( $\mathrm{GeV} / \mathrm{c}^{2}$ ) and decays rapidly into other particles. Here are some key facts:

1. The Higgs boson gets its mass from its interactions with its associated Higg's field.
2. It can be a unique portal to find the conditions of universe shortly after the Big Bang and signs of dark matter due to its distinctive characteristics and properties.

# 12.8 CONSERVATION LAWS

All nuclear processess such as nuclear reactions and nuclear decays obey conservation laws such as:

1. conservation of energy, momentum and charge. It includes the nucleon number N and charge number Z.
2. baryon number
3. lepton number

Hadrons
Mesons, e.g. plons, kaons
baryons, e.g. protons, neutrons, omega, sigma and lambda particles
Non-hatrons
Leptons, including electrons, muon, neutrinos
photons, gravions

### 12.9 THE ASYMMETRY OF MATTER AND ANTI-MATTER IN THE UNIVERSE

Many observations show that there is the asymmetry between matter and anti-matter. This is the most remarkable features of our universe. A number of hypothesis are existed which show that the universe consists almost entirely of matter rather than anti-matter. e.g., the universe is assumed to be composed up $5 \%$ of ordinary matter (electrons, protons and neutrons), $71 \%$ of hydrogen atoms and $24 \%$ of helium atoms, there are no any contribution of anti-hydrogen or anti-helium atoms in the composition of the universe.
The experimental results explain that the matter and anti-matter asymmetry is indeed due to the violation of conservation of baryon number. i.e., there is imbalance number of baryons and its anti-baryons. Now if the particle-antiparticle symmetry is also violated, then there will be a mechanism for making more quarks than anti-quarks, more leptons than anti-leptons and eventually more matter than anti-matter. Hence, it is concluded that the problem asymmetry of matter and anti-matter is still mystery.

### 12.10 MOST OF THE MATTER IN THE OBSERVABLE UNIVERSE IS PLASMA

Our universe is more vast than our thinking, because we still know about its $5 \%$ part but we still do not know about its remaining $95 \%$ part. For example, our universe consists of about $27 \%$ of unknown matter called dark matter and about $68 \%$ a mysterious antigravity material known as dark energy. By adding $27 \%$ and $68 \%$ we have $95 \%$. It means $95 \%$ universe is out of our thinking, i.e., we know nothing about $95 \%$ of the universe.

On the other hand, the $5 \%$ of the universe that we know about it, is an ordinary

matter, where hydrogen and helium are almost in the plasma state. Therefore, these figures indicate that $95 \%$ of the $5 \%$ of the observable universe is the plasma state, while the remaining $5 \%$ is in the form of matter. Hence, it is concluded that most of the matter in the observable universe is plasma.

# 12.11 THE THEORIES ABOUT THE FORCES BETWEEN THE MASSES OF PARTICLES

To explain the interactions between the masses of the particles through different mediators, we have the following two theories, the quantum field theory and the string theory.

## 1. The Quantum Field Theory

According to this theory, each particle is represented by a field called quantum field and it is responsible to transmit a force from one particle to another by a mediator. For example, let a positively charged particle produces an electric field in the space around it. This charged particle exerts an attractive force on a nearby negatively charged particle through its field. Moreover, the field can also carry energy and momentum from one particle to another. Where the energy and momentum of all fields are quantized. The quanta that exchange momentum and energy from one type of particle to another in their field are called field particles. Thus, we can say that the interactions between particles are described in terms of the exchange of field particle or quanta which are all bosons. For example, the electromagnetic force is mediated by photons called quanta of the electromagnetic field. Similarly, the strong nuclear force is mediated by field particles called gluons, the electro-weak force is mediated by the field particles called Bosons ( $W^{\prime}$ and $Z$ ) and the gravitational forces is mediated by field particles called gravitons.

## 2. String Theory

String Theory is an advanced concept in theoretical physics proposing that the fundamental particles of the universe, instead of being point-like, are actually tiny, vibrating strings. These strings can be open or closed loops, and their vibrations
determine the properties of particles, including mass and force. String Theory framework, offering a potential theory of everything, still remains unproved experimentally.

# 12.12 THESTANDARD MODEL

The standard model is the collection of theories that describe the smallest experimentally observed particles of matter and interaction between energy and matter. Three categories of particles form the standard model are shown in Fig. 12.8. Matter, which makes up only $5 \%$ of the universe is composed of quarks and leptons. The fundamental bosons provide three forces: electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force.

The Higg's boson provides an explanation for how the other particles get mass.
This model is still considered incomplete. Currently, it is unable to explain many important features of the known universe such as: (i) gravity (ii) dark matter ( $27 \%$ of the universe (iii) dark energy ( $68 \%$ of the universe).
