# Chapter 28: Chapter 12 Nuclear and Particle Physics

## Learning Objectives

After studying this chapter, the students will be able to:

- State that nucleon number and charge are conserved in nuclear processes
- Describe the composition, mass and charge of α-, β- and γ-radiations (both β-(electrons) and β-(positrons) are included)
- Explain that an anti-particle has the same mass but opposite charge to the corresponding particle (give the example that a positron is the anti-particle of an electron)
- State that (electron) anti-neutrinos are produced during β-decay and (electron) neutrinos are produced during β+decay
- Explain that α-particles have discrete energies but that β-particles have a continuous range of energies because (anti)neutrinos are omitted in β-decay
- Describe quarks and anti-quarks (as a fundamental) including that there are six flavors (types) of quark: up, down, strange, charm, top and bottom
- Describe protons and neutrons in terms of their quark composition
- State that a hadron may be either a baryon (consisting of three quarks) or a meson (consisting of one quark and an antiquark)
- Describe the changes to quark composition that take place during β- and β+decay
- State that electrons and neutrinos are fundamental particles called leptons
- State, W, Z, gluon, and photons as fundamental particles called exchange particles or force carriers
- State the Higgs boson as a fundamental particle which is responsible for the particle's mass
- Explain that every subatomic particle has a corresponding anti-particle (that has the same mass as a given particle but opposite electric or magnetic properties according to the Standard Model of Particle Physics)
- Explain that there are various contending theories about what 'mass' and 'force' are generated from [e.g. that these are generated from quantum fields when they are energized, or from multi-dimensional 'strings' that vibrate in higher dimensions to give rise to particles (no further technical knowledge beyond these simple descriptions is expected at this level)
- Illustrate that anti-particles usually have the same weight, but opposite charge, compared to their matter counterparts
- State that most of the matter in the observable universe is matter
- Describe the asymmetry of matter and anti-matter in the universe as an unsolved mystery
- Describe annihilation reactions (a particle meets its corresponding anti-particle, they undergo annihilation reactions in which either all the mass is converted to heat and light energy, or some mass is left over in the form of new sub-atomic particles)
