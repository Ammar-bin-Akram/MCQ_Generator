## NUCLEAR PHYSICS

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this chapter the students will be able to:

1. Understand the qualitative treatment of Rutherford's scattering experiment and the evidence it provides for the existence and small size of nucleus.
2. Distinguish between nucleon number (mass number) and atomic number.
3. Understand that an element can exist in various isotopic forms each with a different number of neutrons.
4. Understand the use of mass spectrograph to demonstrate the existence of isotopes and to measure their relative abundance.
5. Understand mass defect and calculate binding energy using Einstein's equation.
6. Illustrate graphically the variation of binding energy per nucleon with the mass number.
7. Appreciate the spontaneous and random nature of nuclear decay.

15. Explain the working principle of nuclear reactor.
16. Be aware of various types of nuclear reactors.
17. Show an awareness about nuclear radiation exposure and biological effects of radiation.
18. Describe in simple terms the use of radiations for medical diagnosis and therapy.
19. Understand qualitatively the importance of limiting exposure to ionizing radiation.
20. Outline the use of tracer technique to obtain diagnostic information about internal structures.
21. Describe examples of the use of radioactive tracers in diagnosis.
22. Describe basic forces of nature.
23. Describe the modern view of the building blocks of matter based on hadrons, leptons and quarks.

Soon after the discovery of electron and proton in an atom, the quest started to find the way in which these charged particles are present in an atom. From his experiments Ernest Rutherford developed a nuclear model of the atom. His model of the atom consisted of a small dense, positively charged nucleus with negative electrons orbiting about it. In 1920 Rutherford suggested that there is probably another particle within the nucleus, neutral one, to which he gave the name neutron. James Chadwick discovered neutron in 1932.
