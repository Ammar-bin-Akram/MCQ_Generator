# Chapter 20: Applications of Thermistors

## Temperature Measurement

Thermistors are used in thermometers, and electric devices such as air conditioners, refrigerators, heaters, microwave ovens, incubators, etc.to monitor temperature.
Thermistors with high negative temperature coefficient are very accurate for measuring low temperatures especially near 10 K . The higher resistance at low temperature enables more accurate measurement possible.
Thermistors have wide applications as temperature sensors, i.e. they convert changes of temperature into electrical voltage which is duly processed. For example, these are used in coolant temperature sensors in automobile engines to prevent the engine overheating and in digital thermometers.

## Temperature Compensation

Thermistors are used in circuits where temperature changes could affect performance. Such as in oscillators, battery charging circuits and power systems.

## Inrush Current Limiting

Thermistors are used to limit the initial flow of current when a device is first turned on.

## Voltage Divider

Thermistors are widely used as voltage divider. As shown in Fig. 9.36 when temperature of a thermistor increases, its resistance decreases. This decreases the voltage drop across the thermistor. As a result, the potential at point B increases that can be used to trigger a circuit connected to it. In case of a fire alarm, the use of a thermistor turns the NOT gate low when it gets heated. The output of NOT gate goes high and
turns the siren ON

### 9.21 LIGHT DEPENDENT RESISTOR

Light dependent resistor (LDR) is a resistor whose resistance decreases with increasing light intensity. Due to this property, it is also known as photo resistor. The LDRs are typically made from semiconductor material like cadmium sulphide. The material is deposited in a special pattern on an insulating plate.

## Working Principle

The principle used in an LDR is the increase in the conductivity of the material on exposing it to light. In darkness, the semiconductor material has a few free electrons (charge carriers) resulting in high resistance. When light photons hit the material, they

transfer energy to electrons in the outer orbits, thus, making them free to conduct electricity. This decreases the resistance of LDR. The amount of light hitting the LDR's surface determines the number of free elections. Conversely, less light results in lowering the free elections, thus, making higher resistance. This change in resistance can be measured and used in circuits to sense light levels.
