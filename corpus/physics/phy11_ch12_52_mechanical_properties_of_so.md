# Chapter 12: 5.2 MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS

## Deformation in Solids

If we hold a soft rubber ball in our hand and then squeeze it, the shape or volume of the ball will change. However, if we stop squeezing the ball, and open our hand, the ball will return to its original spherical shape. This has been illustrated schematically in Fig. 5.1.
Similarly, if we hold two ends of a rubber string in our hands, and move our hands apart to some extent, the length of the
string will increase under the action of the applied force (a) Originalrubber ball exerted by our hands. Greater the applied force, larger will be (b) Squeezed rubber ball the increase in length. Now on removing the applied force, the (c) Rubber ball after removing string will return to its original length. From these examples, it is concluded that deformation (i.e., change in shape, length or volume) is produced when a body is subjected to some external force.
In crystalline solids, atoms are usually arranged in a certain order. These atoms are held about their equilibrium position, which depends on the strength of the inter-atomic cohesive force between them. Under the influence of external force, distortion occurs in the solid bodies because of the displacement of the atoms from their equilibrium position and the body is said to be in a state of stress. After the removal of external force, the atoms return to their equilibrium position, and the body regains its original shape, provided that external applied force was not too great. The ability of the body to return to its original shape is called elasticity. Figure 6.2. illustrates deformation produced in a unit cell of a crystal subjected to an external applied force.

# 5.3 STRESS, STRAIN AND YOUNG'S MODULUS

The results of mechanical tests are usually expressed in terms of stress and strain, which are defined in terms of applied force and deformation.

## Stress

It is defined as the force applied per unit area to produce any change in the shape, volume or length of a body. Mathematically, it is expressed as:

$$
\text { Stress }(\sigma)=\frac{\text { Force }(F)}{\text { Area }(A)}
$$

The SI unit of stress ( $\sigma$ ) is newton per square metre ( $\mathrm{N} \mathrm{m}^{2}$ ), which is given the name pascal (Pa). Stress may cause a change in length, volume and shape. When a stress changes length, it is called the tensile stress, when it changes the volume, it is called the volume stress and when it changes the shape, it is called the shear stress.

## Strain

Strain is a measure of the deformation of a solid when stress is applied to it. In the case of deformation in one dimension, strain is defined as the fractional change in length. If $\Delta L$ is the change in length and $L$ is the original length (Fig. 5.3-a), then strain is given by

$$
\text { Strain }(\varepsilon)=\frac{\text { Change in length }(\Delta L)}{\text { Original length }(L)}
$$

Since strain is the ratio of lengths, it is dimensionless and therefore, has no units. If strain $\varepsilon$ is due to tensile stress $\sigma$ it is called tensile strain, and if it is produced as a result of compressive stress $\sigma$, it is termed as compressive strain.
In case when the applied stress changes the volume, the change in volume per unit volume is known as volumetric strain as shown in Fig. 5.3 (b), thus

Volumetric strain $\left(\varepsilon_{v}\right)=\frac{\Delta V}{V_{0}}$
Fig. 5.3(b): Volumetric strain
Fig. 5.3(c): Shear strain

Let $y$ be the distance between two opposite faces of a rigid body (Fig. 5.3-c), which are subjected to shear stress one of its face slides through a distance $\Delta x$, then shear strain is produced which is is given by

$$
\text { Shear strain }(\gamma)=\frac{\Delta x}{\gamma}=\tan \theta
$$

However, for small value of angle $\theta$, measured in radian $\tan \theta \cong \theta$, so that

$$
\gamma=0
$$

## Young's Modulus

The stress applied per unit strain is called Young's modulus
i.e. $Y=\frac{\text { Tensile stress }}{\text { Tensile strain }}$

$$
Y=\frac{F / A}{\Delta L / L_{0}}
$$

It has the same unit as that of stress i.e., $\mathrm{N} \mathrm{m}^{2}$. The value of Young's modulus of different material is given in Table 5.1.
There are various methods to determine the Young's modulus of a wire. One of the method is Searle's method.

## Chapter 5. Solids and Fluid Dynamics

## For your intonstion

Although it is named after the 19th century British Scientist Thames Young, the concept was developed in 1727 by Leonhard Euller.

# 5.4 DETERMINATION OF YOUNG'S MODULUS OF A WIRE

Experimentally, the magnitude of Young's modulus for a material in the form of wire can be found out mostly with the help of Searle's apparatus as shown in Fig. 5.4.
It consists of two wires, reference wire and test wire of equal lengths of same material having same diameters attached to a rigid support. Both wires are connected to horizontal bars (frames $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$ ) at the other ends. Hang a constant weight to the hook of horizontal bar of reference wire and hanger on test wire so that wire remains stretched and free from kinks.

## The following procedure is adopted for finding Young's modulus of a wire experimentally.

1. Measure the initial length $L_{0}$ of the wire using a metre scale.
2. Measure the diameter ' $d$ ' of the wire using a screw guage. The diameter should be messured at several
Fig. 5.4: Bearle's apparatus

different points along the wire and take average.
3. Adjust the spirit level so that it is in horizontal position by turning the micrometer. Record the micrometer reading to use it as the reference reading.
4. Load the test wire with a further weight, the spirit level tilts due to elongation of the test wire.
5. Adjust the micrometer screw to restore the spirit level in the horizontal position. Subtract the first micrometer reading from the second micrometer reading to obtain the extension of the test wire.
6. Calculate stress and strain from the following formula:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Stress } & =\frac{\text { Weight }}{\text { Area of wire }}=\frac{F}{A}=\frac{m g}{\pi r^{2}} \\
\text { Strain } & =\frac{\Delta L}{L_{y}}=\frac{\text { Change in length }}{\text { Original length }}
\end{aligned}
$$

7. Repeat the above steps by increasing load on test wire to obtain more values of stresses and strains.
8. Plot the above values on stress strain graph, it should be straight line. Now determine the value of slope $Y$. The value of slope is equal to Young's modulus of wire.

## Strain seaper

A steel rod and a rubber band are subjected to a same force. Which one will be stretched more?

# 5.5 ELASTIC DEFORMATION, PLASTIC DEFORMATION AND ELASTIC LIMIT

In a tensile test machine, metal wire is extended at a specified deformation rate, and stresses generated in the wire during deformation are continuously measured by a suitable electronic device fitted in the mechanical testing machine. Force-elongation diagram or stress-strain curve is plotted automatically on X-Y chart recorder. A typical stress-strain curve for a ductile material is shown in Fig. 5.5.
In the initial stage of deformation, stress is increased linearly with the strain till we reach point $A$ on the stress-strain curve. This is called proportional limit $\left(\sigma_{0}\right)$. It is defined as the greatest stress that a material can withstand without losing straight line proportionality between stress and strain. Hooke's law which states that the strain (deformation) is directly proportional to stress (force or load) is obeyed in the region OA. From A to B, stress and strain are not proportional.

## Elastic limit

Strain
Fig. 5.5: Stress-strain curve of a typical ductile material.

If the load is removed at any point between $O$ and $B$, the curve will be retraced and the material will return to its original state. In the region OB , the material is said to be

elastic. The point $B$ is called the yield point. The value of stress at $B$ is known as elastic limit $\sigma_{e}$.

# Plastic Deformation

If the stress is increased beyond the yield stress or elastic limit of the material, the specimen becomes permanently changed and does not recover its original shape or dimension after the stress is removed. This kind of behaviour is called plasticity. The region of plasticity is represented by the portion of the curve from $B$ to $C$, the point $C$ in Fig. 5.5 represents the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) $\sigma_{e}$ of the material. The UTS is defined as the maximum stress that a material can withstand, and can be regarded as the nominal strength of the material. Once point $C$ corresponding to UTS is crossed, the material breaks at point D, responding the fracture stress ( $\sigma_{i}$ ).

## Ductile substances

Substances which undergo plastic deformation until they break, are known as ductile substances. For example, Lead, copper and wrought iron are ductile substances.

## Brittle Substances

The substances which break just after the elastic limit is reached, are known as brittle substances. For example, glass and high carbon steel are brittle. Moreover, Beryllium, Bismuth, Chromium are also brittle metals.

Example 5.1 A steel wire 12 mm in diameter is fastened to a log and is then pulled by a tractor. The length of steel wire between the log and the tractor is 11 m . A force of $10,000 \mathrm{~N}$ is required to pull the log. Calculate: (a) the stress and strain in the wire. (b) how much does the wire stretch when the log is pulled? $\left(E=200 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{~m}^{2}\right)$

Solution (a) Tensile stress $\sigma=\frac{F}{A}=\frac{10,000 \mathrm{~N}}{3.14\left(6 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m}\right)^{2}}=88.46 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{Nm}^{-2}$
Tensile strain $\varepsilon=\frac{\Delta L}{L_{0}}$; also $E=\frac{\text { Stress }}{\text { Strain }}=\frac{88.46 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{Nm}^{2}}{\text { Strain }}=200 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{Nm}^{2}$

$$
\text { Strain }=\frac{88.46 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{Nm}^{2}}{200 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{Nm}^{2}}=4.4 \times 10^{-4}
$$

(b) Using the relation; Strain $=\frac{\Delta L}{L_{0}}$ or $\Delta L=$ Strain $\times L_{0}=4.4 \times 10^{-4} \times 11 \mathrm{~m}=4.84 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m}$

### 5.6 STRAIN ENERGY IN DEFORMED MATERIALS

When a body is deformed by a force, work is done against elastic restoring force. It is stored in it as its potential energy and is equal to the gain in potential energy of the molecules of a body due to the displacement of these molecules from their mean positions.

## Derivation of Expression for Energy Stored in a Stretched Material

Consider a material in the form of a spring as shown in Fig. 5.6. It is stretched by a

force $F$ through extension $x$. As the extension is directly proportional to the stretching force within the elastic limit, therefore the force increases uniformly from zero to $F$ as shown in Fig. 5.7. Thus, the average force that stretches the spring through $x$ is $1 / 2 F$. Hence work done by the stretching force will be given as:
Work done $=$ Average force $\times$ Distance in the direction of the force

$$
W=\frac{1}{2} F \times x
$$

From Hooke's law

$$
F=k(x)
$$

Therefore,

$$
W=\left(\frac{1}{2} k x\right) \cdot(x)=\frac{1}{2} k x^{2}
$$

or

$$
W=\text { Area of } O P Q
$$

The work done by the stretching force is stored in the spring as its strained energy and is equal to the potential energy stored in its molecules.
Strained energy stored in the body $E=\frac{1}{2} F \cdot x=\frac{1}{2} k x^{2}$
For your intonstion
The amount of work done in stretching a material is equal to the average force applied multiplied by the distance moved.
Therefore, the area under a force-extension graph represents the work done to stretch the material, Work done to stretch the material is also equal to elastic $P E$. stored in the material.

# 5.7 ARCHIMEDES' PRINCIPLE AND FLOATATION

An air-filled balloon immediately shoots up to the surface when released under the surface of water. The same would happen if a piece of wood is released under water. We might have noticed that a mug filled with water feels light under water but feels heavy as soon as we take it out of water.
More than two thousand years ago, the Greek scientist, Archimedes noticed that there is an upward force which acts on an object which is kept inside a liquid. As a result, an apparent reduction in weight of the object is observed. This upward force acting on the object is called the upthrust of the liquid. Archimedes' principle states that:

When an object is totally or partially immersed in a liquid, an upthrust acts on it equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces.
Consider a solid cylinder of cross-sectional area $A$ and height $h$ immersed in a liquid as shown in Fig. 5.8. Let $h_{1}$ and $h_{2}$ be the depths of the top and bottom faces of the cylinder respectively from the surface of the liquid. Then

$$
h_{2}-h_{1}=h
$$

If $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ are the liquid pressures at depths $h_{1}$ and $h_{2}$ respectively and $\rho$ is its density, then using equation $P=\rho g h$ of liquid pressure at height $h$ :

$$
P_{1}=\rho g h_{1}
$$

and $\quad P_{2}=\rho g h_{2}$
Let the force $F_{1}$ be exerted at the top of cylinder by the liquid due to pressure $P_{2}$ and the force $F_{2}$ be exerted at the bottom of the cylinder by the liquid due to $P_{2}$. Then $F_{1}=P_{1} A=\rho g h_{1} A$
and $\quad F_{2}=P_{2} A=\rho g h_{2} A$
Fig. 5.8. Upthrust on a body immersed in a liquid is equal to the weight of the liquid displaced.
$F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$ are the forces acting on the opposite faces of the cylinder. Therefore, the net force $F$ will be equal to the difference of these forces. This net force $F$ on the cylinder is called the upthrust of the liquid. Hence

$$
\begin{aligned}
F_{2}-F_{1} & =\rho g h_{1} A-\rho g h_{1} A \\
& =\rho g A\left(h_{2}-h_{1}\right) \ldots \ldots(5.10)
\end{aligned}
$$

or Upthrust of liquid $=\rho g A h$

$$
\text { Upthrust }=\rho g V
$$

Here $A h$ is the volume $V$ of the cylinder and is equal to the volume of the liquid displaced by the cylinder, therefore, $\rho g V$ is the weight of the liquid displaced. This equation shows that an upthrust acts on a body immersed in a liquid and is equal to the weight of liquid displaced, which is Archimede's principle.

Example 5.2 A wooden cube of sides 10 cm each has been dipped completely in water. Calculate the upthurst of water acting on it.

# Given

| Length of side | $L=10 \mathrm{~cm}=0.1 \mathrm{~m}$ |
| :-- | :-- |
| Volume | $V=L^{2}=(0.1 \mathrm{~m})^{2}=1 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m}^{3}$ |
| Density of water | $\rho=1000 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}$ |
| Upthrust | $F=$ ? |

Using Archimede's principle
Upthrust of water

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =\rho g V \\
& =1000 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3} \times 9.8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-2} \times 1 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m}^{3}=9.8 \mathrm{~N}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Brain teaser

Why does a ship made of heavy steel float on water, while a small rock sink?

Thus, upthrust of water acting on the wooden cube is 9.8 N .

# Floatation

An object sinks into a fluid if its weight is greater than the upthrust acting on it. However, an object floats if its weight is equal or less than the upthrust. When an object floats in a fluid, the upthrust acting on it is equal to the weight of the object. In case of floating object, the object may be partially immersed. The upthrust is always equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. This is the principle of floatation. It states that:

A floating object displaces a fluid having weight equal to the weight of the object.
Archimedes' principle is applicable on liquids as well as on gases. We find numerous applications of this principle in our daily life.

## Applications

Following are some important applications of Archimedes' principle.

## 1. Hot-air balloon

The reason why hot-air balloons (Fig. 5.9) rise and float in mid-air is because of the density of the hot-air balloon is less than the surrounding air. When the upthrust of the surrounded air is more, it starts to rise. This is done by varying the quantity of hot air in the balloon.
Fig. 5.9

## 2. Wooden block floating on water

A wooden block floats on water. It is because the weight of an equal volume of water is greater than the weight of the block. According to the principle of floatation, a body floats if its displaced water is equal to the weight of the body when it is partially or completely immersed in water.

## 3. Ships and boats

Ships and boats are designed on the same principle of floatation. They carry passengers and goods over water. It would sink in water if its total weight becomes greater than the upthrust of water.

## 4. Submarine

A submarine can travel over as well as under water using the same principle of floatation.
It floats over water when the weight of water equal to its volume is greater than its weight. Under this condition, it is similar to a ship and remains partially above water level. It has a system of tanks which can be filled with and emptied from seawater. When these tanks are
Fig.5.10 (a): A ship floating over water
Fig.5.10 (b): Submarine

# Physics II

filled with seawater, the weight of the submarine increases. As soon as its weight becomes greater than the upthrust, it dives into water and remains under water. To come up on the surface, the tanks are made empty from seawater.
Example 5.3 An empty meteorological balloon weighs 80 N . It is filled with 10 cubic metres of hydrogen. How much maximum contents the balloon can lift besides its own weight? The density of hydrogen is $0.09 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}$ and the density of air is $1.3 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}$.

## Solution Given:

Weight of the balloon $w=80 \mathrm{~N}$
Volume of hydrogen $V=10 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$
Density of hydrogen $\rho_{1}=0.09 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{3}$
Density of air $\rho_{2}=1.3 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}$
Weight of hydrogen $w_{1}=$ ?
Weight of the contents $w_{2}=$ ?
Upthrust $F=$ Weight of air displaced
$=\rho_{1} g V$
$=1.3 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3} \times 9.8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-2} \times 10 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$
$=127.4 \mathrm{~N}$
Weight of hydrogen $w_{1}=\rho_{1} \mathrm{Vg}$
$=0.09 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3} \times 10 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \times 9.8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}$
Total weight lifted $=w+w_{2}+w_{0}$
To lift the contents, the total weight of the balloon should not exceed $F$.
Thus

$$
\begin{aligned}
w+w_{1}+w_{2} & =F \\
80 \mathrm{~N}+8.82 \mathrm{~N}+w_{2} & =127.4 \mathrm{~N} \\
w_{0} & =38.58 \mathrm{~N}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the maximum weight of 38.58 N can be lifted by the balloon in addition to its own weight.

### 5.8 STEADY, NON-VISCOUS AND IDEAL FLUID

Moving fluids have great importance. In order to find the behaviour of the fluid in motion, we consider their flow through the pipes. When a fluid is in motion, its flow can take place in two ways, either streamline or turbulent.

## Streamline or Laminar Flow

The flow is said to be streamline or laminar flow.

If every particle that passes a particular point, moves along exactly the same path, as followed by particles which passed that points earlier.

In a steady flow of a fluid, the motion of the particles is smooth and regular, as shown in Fig. 5.11. The smooth path followed by fluid particles in laminar flow is called a streamline. The streamline may be the straight or curved and tangent to any point gives the direction of flow of a fluid. The different
Fig. 5.11: Streamlines (laminar flow)
streamlines cannot cross each other.
Example: A fluid flowing in a pipe as shown in Fig. 5.12 will have certain velocity $v_{1}$ at $P$, a velocity $v_{2}$ at $Q$ and so on. If the velocity of a particle of the fluid at $P, Q$ and $R$ does not change with the passage of time, then the flow is said to be steady flow or streamline flow.
Fig. 5.12: The velocities of the particles at different points on streamline.

The line PQR which represents the path followed by the particle is called a streamline. It represents the fixed path followed by orderly processing particles. In streamline flow, all the particles passing through $P$ also pass through $Q$ and $R$. It means that two streamlines cannot cross each other.

# Turbulent Flow

The irregular or unsteady flow of the fluid is called turbulent flow.
Fig. 5.13: Turbulent flow

Above a certain velocity of the fluid flow, the motion of the fluid becomes unsteady and irregular. Under this condition, the velocity of the fluid changes abruptly as shown in the Fig. 5.13. In this case, the exact path of the particles cannot be considered.
If two streamlines cross each other, then the particles will go in one or in the other directions and flow will not be a steady flow. Such a flow is a turbulent flow. When the flow is unsteady or turbulent, there are eddies and whirlpools in the motion and the paths of the particles are continuously changing.

## Ideal Fluid

The behaviour of the fluid which satisfies the following conditions is called Ideal fluid:

1. The fluid is non-viscous i.e., there is no frictional force between adjacent layers of the fluid.
Formula One racing cars have a streamlined design.
Dolphins have streamlined bodies to assist their movement in water.

2. The fluid is incompressible i.e., its density is constant.
3. The fluid motion is steady.

# Rate of Flow

The rate of flow of a fluid through a pipe is the volume of the fluid passing through any section of pipe per unit time.

## Formula For Rate of Flow

Consider a fluid flowing through a pipe of area of cross-section $A$ as shown in Fig. 5.14. Let the velocity of the fluid be $v$ and it flows through the pipe for time $t$, then the distance covered by the fluid in time is:

$$
t=v t
$$

Fig. 5.14: Rate of flow of a liquid
where $t$ is the length of the pipe through which the fluid passes in time $t$. Volume of the fluid passing through the pipe in time $t$, is:

$$
A \times t=A v t
$$

Thus The rate of flow of the liquid $=\frac{\text { Volume }}{\text { Time }}$

$$
=\frac{A v t}{t}=A v
$$

$$
\text { Rate of flow }=A v
$$

In SI units, it is measured in cubic metre per second ( $\mathrm{m}^{3} \mathrm{~s}^{1}$ ). Sometimes, it is also measured in litres per second ( $\mathrm{L} \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ ).

## Steady Flow

If the overall flow pattern does not change with time, the flow is called steady flow.
In steady flow, every particle of the fluid follows the same flow line as its previous particle.

### 5.9 EQUATION OF CONTINUITY

## Statement

The product of cross-sectional area of the pipe and the fluid speed (i.e., $A v$ ) at any point along the pipe is a constant. This constant is equal to the volume flow per second of the fluid or simply the flow rate.

Thus

$$
A v=\text { Constant }=\frac{\text { Volume }}{\text { Time }}
$$

Consider a fluid flowing through a pipe of non-uniform size.
Fig. 5.15: Steady flow of a fluid

The particles in the fluid move along the same lines in a steady state flow as shown in Fig 5.15.
If we consider the flow for a short interval of time $\Delta t$, the fluid at the lower end of the tube covers a distance $\Delta x$, with a velocity $v_{1}$, then distance covered by the fluid is:

$$
\Delta x_{1}=v_{1} \Delta t
$$

Let $A_{1}$ be the area of cross-section of the lower end, then volume of the fluid that flows into the tube at $A_{1}$ is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& V=A_{1} \Delta x_{1} \\
& \text { or } \quad V=A_{1} v_{1} \Delta t
\end{aligned}
$$

## Scientific Fact

Euler obtained the continuity equation for a incompressible fluid with a large number of terms in 1752. Later, it was translated by C. Truesdell from Englisin in 1954.

If $\rho_{1}$ is the density of the fluid, then the mass of the fluid contained in the shaded region (through $A_{1}$ ) is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Delta m_{1}=\text { Volume } \times \text { Density } \\
& \text { or } \quad \Delta m_{1}=A_{1} v_{1} \Delta t \times \rho_{1}
\end{aligned}
$$

Similarly, the mass of the fluid that moves with velocity $v_{2}$ through the upper end of the pipe having cross-sectional area $A_{2}$ in the same time $\Delta t$ is given by

$$
\Delta m_{2}=A_{2} v_{2} \Delta t \times \rho_{2}
$$

where $\rho_{2}$ is the density of the fluid flowing out through $A_{2}$ and $\Delta m_{2}$ indicates small mass. If the fluid is incompressible and the flow is steady, the mass of the fluid is conserved. That is the mass flowing into the bottom of the pipe through $A_{1}$ in a time $\Delta t$ must be equal to the fluid flowing out though $A_{2}$ in the same time. Therefore,

$$
\Delta m_{1}=\Delta m_{2}
$$

So

$$
A_{1} v_{1} \Delta t \times \rho_{1}=A_{2} v_{2} \Delta t \times \rho_{2}
$$

or

$$
A_{1} v_{2} \rho_{1}=A_{2} v_{2} \rho_{2}
$$

Equation (5.15) is called the equation of continuity. Since density is constant for the steady flow of incompressible fluid, therefore, the equation of continuity becomes:

$$
A_{1} v_{1}=A_{2} v_{2}
$$

Equation (5.16) states that in steady flow, the rate of flow of the fluid inward is equal to the rate of flow of the fluid outward.
This equation justifies the conservation of mass of the fluid which is flowing through a pipe.

A water hose with an internal diameter of 20 mm at the outlet discharge 30 kg of water in 60 s . Calculate the water speed at the outlet. Assume the density of water is $1000 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}$ and its flow is steady.

Internal diameter of water hose $D=20 \mathrm{~mm}=0.02 \mathrm{~m}$
Solution Radius

$$
r=\frac{D}{2}=\frac{0.02 \mathrm{~m}}{2}=0.01 \mathrm{~m}
$$

| Physica III |  | (0) |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Mass of water | $m=30 \mathrm{~kg}$ |  |
| Time taken | $t=60 \mathrm{~s}$ |  |
| Density of water | $\rho=1000 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}$ |  |
| Speed of water | $v=$ ? |  |
| Mass flow per second $m / t$ |  | $=30 \mathrm{~kg} / 60 \mathrm{~s}$ |
|  |  | $=0.5 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ |
| Cross-sectional area | $A=$ | $\pi r^{2}$ |
|  |  | $=3.14 \times(0.01 \mathrm{~m})^{2}$ |
|  |  | $=3.14 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ |

From equation of continuity, the mass of water discharging per second through area $A$ is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\rho A v & =\text { Mass } / \text { Second } \\
v & =\frac{\text { Mass } / \text { Second }}{\rho A} \\
v & =\frac{0.5 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}{1000 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{3} \times 3.14 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~m}^{2}} \\
& =1.6 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

As the water falls, its speed increases and so, is cross sectional area decreases as mandated by the continuity equation.

## The equation of continuity is applied to:
(i) blood flow in arteries and veins
(ii) water flow in rivers and pipes
(iii) air flow in duct and ventilation systems.

# 5.10 INCREASEIN FLOWVELOCITY

We can increase the flow velocity of water in a rubber pipe by squeezing it. When we squeeze the rubber pipe, we decrease the cross-sectional area through which the water flows. According to the equation of continuity,

$$
A_{1} v_{1}=A_{2} v_{2}
$$

where $A$ is the cross-sectional area and $v$ is the flow velocity. By decreasing the crosssectional area $\left(A_{2}<A_{1}\right)$, the velocity of the water $\left(v_{2}\right)$ must increase to maintain the same flow rate. Therefore, squeezing the rubber pipe increases the flow velocity of fluid.

### 5.11 BERNOULLI'S EQUATION

The sum of pressure, $K . E$. per unit volume and P.E. per unit volume of an ideal fluid throughoutits steady flowremains constant.

As the fluid moves through a pipe of varying crosssection and height, the pressure will change along the pipe. Bernoulli's equation is the fundamental equation in fluid dynamics that relates pressure to fluid speed and height.
Fig. 5.16: The speed of water spraying from the end of a garden hose increases as the hose is squeezed with the thumb.

In deriving Bernoulli's equation, we assume that the fluid is incompressible, non-viscous and flows in a steady state manner. Let us consider the flow of the fluid through the pipe in time $t$, as shown in Fig. 5.17.
The force on the upper end of the fluid is $P_{1} A_{1}$ where $P_{1}$ is the pressure and $A_{1}$ is the area of cross-section at the upper end. The work done on the fluid, by the fluid behind it, in moving it through a distance $\Delta x_{1}$, will be:

$$
W_{1}=F_{1} \Delta x_{1}=P_{1} A_{1} \Delta x_{1}
$$

Similarly, the work done on the fluid at the lower end is:

$$
W_{2}=-F_{2} \Delta x_{2}=-P_{2} A_{2} \Delta x_{2}
$$

Fig. 5.17: An ideal flow of fluid through a non-uniform cross-section pip at different heights.
where $P_{2}$ is the pressure, $A_{2}$ is the area of cross-section of lower end and $\Delta x_{2}$ is the distance moved by the fluid in same time interval $t$. The work $W_{2}$ is taken to be -ve as this work is done against the fluid force. The net work done will be:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& W=W_{1}+W_{2} \\
& W=P_{1} A_{1} \Delta x_{1}-P_{2} A_{2} \Delta x_{2} \\
& \text { or } \\
& W_{1} A_{1} v_{1} t-P_{2} A_{2} v_{1} t
\end{aligned}
$$

From equation of continuity;

Hence

$$
A_{1} v_{1}=A_{1} v_{2}
$$

$$
A_{1} v_{1} t=A_{2} v_{2} t=V \text { (volume) }
$$

So

$$
W=\left(P_{1}-P_{2}\right) V
$$

If $m$ is the mass and $p$ is the density, then $V=\frac{m}{p}$. So, Eq. (5.18) becomes:

$$
W=\left(P_{1}-P_{2}\right) \frac{m}{p}
$$

A part of this work is utilized by the fluid in changing its $K . E$. and a part is used in changing its gravitational P.E.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Change in } K . E .=\Delta K . E .=\frac{1}{2} m v_{2}^{2}-\frac{1}{2} m v_{1}^{2} \\
& \text { Change in } P . E .=\Delta P . E=m g h_{2}-m g h_{1}
\end{aligned}
$$

where $h_{1}$ and $h_{2}$ are the heights of the upper and lower ends respectively.
Applying the law of conservation of energy to this volume of the fluid, we have

$$
\left(P_{1}-P_{2}\right) \frac{m}{\rho}=\frac{1}{2} m v_{2}^{2}-\frac{1}{2} m v_{1}^{2}+m g h_{2}-m g h_{1} \ldots \ldots(5.22)
$$

Rearranging Eq. (5.22), we have

$$
P_{1}+\frac{1}{2} \rho v_{1}^{2}+\rho g h_{1}=P_{2}+\frac{1}{2} \rho v_{2}^{2}+\rho g h_{2}
$$

This is Bernoulli's equation and is often expressed as:

$$
P+\frac{1}{2} \rho v^{2}+\rho g h=\text { constant }
$$

# 5.12 USES OF BERNOULLI'S EQUATION

A number of devices operate by means of pressure difference that results from changes in the speed of the fluid.

## 1. Aeroplane Wings

Uplifting of an aeroplane is due to the designing of Its wings, which deflect the air so that streamlines are closer together above the wing than below it as illustrated in Fig.5.18. We have seen that where the streamlines are forced closer together, the speed is faster. Thus, air is travelling faster on the upper side of the wing than
Fig. 5.18: Lift of an acroplano
on the lower. The pressure will be lower at the top of the wing, and the wing will be forced upward and the lift of an aeroplane is due to this effect.

## 2. Swing of a Ball

When a ball is thrown or kicked with spin or the ball is made smoother on one side by the bowler and remains rough on the other side, the air moves faster over rough side and slows over the smoother (Fig. 5.19). According to Bernoulli's equation, the faster moving air creates lower pressure, while the slower moving air creates higher pressure, this pressure difference generates a sideways force, known as Magnus effect which causes the ball to curves in the air.

## 3. Filter Pump

Fig. 5.19: Turbulent flow

A filter pump has a constriction in the centre, so that a jet of water from the tap flows faster here. This causes a drop in pressure near it and air, therefore, flows in from the side tube. The air and water together are expelled through the lower part of the pump (Fig. 5.20).

# 4. Carburetor

The carburetor of a car engine uses a Venturi duct to feed the correct mixture of air and petrol to the cylinders. Air is drawn through the duct and along a pipe to the cylinders (Fig. 5.21). Atiny inlet at the side of duct is fed with petrol.
The air through the duct moves very fast, creating low pressure in the duct, which draws petrol vapours into the air stream.

## 5. Paint Sprayer

A stream of air passing over a tube dipped in a liquid will cause the liquid to rise in the tube as shown in Fig. 5.22. This effect is used in perfume bottles and paint sprayers. Actually when the rubber ball of atomizer is squeezed, the air is blown through tube and it rushes out through the narrow aperture with high speed and it causes fall of pressure. So, the atmospheric pressure puanes the perfume up leading to the narrow aperture.

## 6. Venturi Relation

Consider a pipe within which a fluid of density $p$ is flowing through different areas of cross-section as shown in the Fig. 5.23.
Let $A_{1}$ be the cross-sectional area at wide end and $A_{2}$ be the cross-sectional area at narrow portion.
Suppose that $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ be the flow speeds at the wide and narrow portions respectively. Pressure $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ indicate the liquid pressure at both the portions by connecting the limbs of the
Fig. 5.23: Venturi meter
manometer.

As the pipe is placed horizontally, therefore, we consider that average potential energy is the same at both places while using Bernoulli's equation.
Thus, Bernoulli's equation can be written as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& P_{1}+\frac{1}{2} p v_{1}^{2}=P_{2}-\frac{1}{2} p v_{2}^{2} \\
& \text { or } \quad P_{1}-P_{2}=\frac{1}{2} p v_{2}^{2}-\frac{1}{2} p v_{1}^{2} \\
& \text { or } \quad P_{1}-P_{2}=\frac{1}{2} p\left(v_{2}^{2}-v_{1}^{2}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

From the equation of continuity:

$$
\begin{aligned}
A_{1} v_{1} & =A_{2} v_{2} \\
v_{1} & =\frac{A_{2} v_{2}}{A_{1}}
\end{aligned}
$$

## 5. Solids and Fluid Dynamics

## 1. It is clear from the result of Bernoulli's Equation for horizontal pipe that "where speed is high, the pressure will be low". Mathematicallily,

$$
P+\frac{1}{2} p v^{2}=\text { constant }
$$

or

$$
v_{1}=\frac{A_{2} v_{2}}{A_{1}}
$$

As the cross-sectional area $A_{2}$ is small as compared to the area $A_{1}$ as is clear from the figure, i.e. $A_{2}<A_{1}$. So, $v_{1}$ will be small as compared to $v_{2}$. Thus, the speed of the fluid is very slow in wider portion of the pipe as compared to the narrow portion, So, we can neglect $v_{1}$ on the right-hand side of Eq.(5.23). Hence

$$
P_{1}-P_{2}=\frac{1}{2} p v_{2}^{2}
$$

This is known as Venturi relation, which is used in venturi meter, a device used to measure speed of liquid flow.

## 7. Torricelli's Theorem

A simple application of Bernoulli's equation is shown in Fig. 5.24. Suppose a large tank of fluid has two small orifices $A$ and $B$ on it. Let us find the speed with which the water flows from the orifice $A$.
Since the orifices are so small, the efflux speeds $v_{2}$ and $v_{2}$ will be much larger than the speed $v_{1}$ of the top surface of water. We can therefore, take $v_{1}$ as approximately zero. Hence, Bernoulli's equation can be written as:

$$
P_{1}+p g h_{1}=P_{2}+\frac{1}{2} p v_{2}^{2}+p g h_{2}
$$

But

$$
P_{1}=P_{2}=\text { Atmospheric pressure }
$$

Fig.5.24:
A tank containing fluid with a orifice.

Therefore, the above equation becomes:

$$
v_{2}=\sqrt{2 g\left(h_{1}-h_{2}\right)}
$$

This is Torricelli's theorem which states that:
The speed of efflux is equal to the velocity gained by the fluid in falling through the distance $\left(h_{1}-h_{2}\right)$ under the action of gravity.

Notice that the speed of the efflux of liquid is the same as the speed of a ball that falls through a height $\left(h_{1}-h_{2}\right)$. The top level of the tank has moved down a little and the P.E. has been transferred into $K . E$. of the efflux of fluid. If the orifice had been pointed upward at $B$ as shown in Fig.6.4, this $K . E$. would allow the liquid to rise to the level of water tank. In practice, viscous-energy losses would alter the result to some extent.

# 5.13 VISCOUS DRAG AND STOKES' LAW

The frictional effect between different layers of a flowing fluid is described in terms of viscosity of the fluid. Viscosity measures, how much force is required to slide one layer of the liquid over another layer. Substances that do not flow easily, such as thick tar and honey, etc., have large coefficients of viscosity, usually denoted by Greek letter ' $\eta$ '. Substances which flow easily, like water, have small coefficient of viscosities. Since liquids and gases have non zero viscosity, therefore, a force is required if an object is to be moved through them. Even the small viscosity of the air causes a large retarding force on a car as it travels at high speed. If you stick out your hand out of the window of a fast moving car, you can easily recognize that considerable force has to be exerted on your hand to move it through the air. These are typical examples of the following fact.

An object moving through a fluid experiences a retarding force called a drag force. The drag force increases as the speed of the object increases.
Even in the simplesl cases, the exact value of the drag force is difficult to calculate. However, the case of a sphere moving through a fluid is of great importance.
The drag force $F$ on a sphere of radius $r$ moving slowly with speed $v$ through a fluid of viscosity $\eta$ is given by Stokes' law as under:

$$
F=6 \pi \pi r v
$$

However, at high speeds the force is no longer simply proportional to speed.

### 5.14 TERMINAL VELOCITY

A chimney works best when it is tall and exposed to air currents, which reduces the pressure at the top and forces the upward flow of smoke.

Consider a water droplet having radius $r$ such as that of fog falling vertically, the air drag on the water droplet increases with speed. The droplet accelerates rapidly under the over powering force of gravity which pulls the droplet rapidly downward due to force of gravity. However, the upward drag force on it increases as the speed of the droplet

increases. The net force on the droplet is
Net force $=$ Weight - Drag force
As the speed of the droplet continues to increase, the drag force eventually approaches the weight in the magnitude. Finally, when the magnitude of the drag force becomes equal to the weight, the net force acting on the droplet is zero. Then the droplet will fall with constant speed called terminal velocity.
To find the terminal velocity $v$, in this case, we use Stokes' law for the drag force. Equating it to the weight of the drop, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 0=m g-6 \pi \eta r v_{1} \\
& v_{1}=\frac{m g}{6 \pi \eta r}
\end{aligned}
$$

The mass of the droplet is $\rho V$, where $V=\frac{4}{3} \pi r^{3}$ is the volume of the sphere.
Substituting above values in the Eq. (5.28), we have

$$
v_{1}=\frac{2 g r^{2} \rho}{9 \eta}
$$

(5.29)

Example 5.5 A tiny water droplet of radius 0.010 cm descends through air from a high building. Calculate its terminal velocity. Given that $\eta$ for air $=19 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ and density of water $p=1000 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}$.

$$
r=1.0 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~m}, \quad \rho=1000 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}, \quad \eta=19 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}
$$

Putting the above values in Eq. (5.29)

$$
v_{1}=\frac{2 \times 9.8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-3} \times\left(1.0 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~m}\right)^{2} \times 1000 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}}{9 \times 19 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}}
$$

Terminal velocity $=1.1 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$.
