## Solids and Fluid Dynamics

## Learning Objectives

After studying this chapter, the students will be able to:

- Distinguish between the structures of crystalline, amorphous, and polymeric solids.
- Describe that deformation of solids in one dimension [That it is caused by a force and that in one dimension, the deformation can be tensile or compressive.]
- Define and use the terms stress, strain and the Young's modulus
- Describe an experiment to determine the Young's modulus of a metal wire.
- Describe and use the terms elastic deformation, plastic deformation and elastic limit
- Justify why and apply the fact that the area under the force-extension graph represents the work done
- Determine the elastic potential energy of a material [That is, deformed within its limit of proportionality from the area under the force-extension graph. Also state and use $E_{0}=\frac{1}{2} k x^{2}$ for a material deformed within its limit of proportionality]
- State and use Archimedes' principle and flotation
- Justify how ships are engineered to float in the sea.
- Define and apply the terms: steady (streamline or laminar) flow, incompressible flow and non viscous flow as applied to the motion of an ideal fluid.
- State and use equation of continuity to solve problems
- Explain that squeezing the end of a rubber pipe results in increase in flow velocity
- Justify that the equation of continuity is a form of the principle of conservation of mass.
- Justify that the pressure difference can arise from different rates of flow of a fluid [Bemoulli effect]
- Explain and apply Bemoulli's equation for horizontal and vertical fluid flow.
- Explain why real fluids are viscous fluids.
- Describe how viscous forces in a fluid cause a retarding force on an object moving through it.
- Describe super fluidity [As the state in which a liquid will experience zero viscosity. Students should know the implications of this state e.g. this allows for super fluids to creep over the walls of containers to 'empty' themselves. It also implies that if you stir a superfluid, the vortices will keep spinning indefinitely.]
- Analyze the real-world applications of the Bemoulli effect [For example, atomizers in perfume bottles, the swinging trajectory of a spinning cricket ball and the lift of a spinning golf ball (the Magnus effect), the use of Venture ducts in filter pumps and car engineers to adjust the flow of fluid, etc.]

Materials have specific uses depending upon their characteristics and properties, such as hardness, ductility, malleability, etc. What makes a metal hard and other soft? It depends upon the structure, the particular order and bonding of atoms and molecules in a material. Similarly, the study of fluids in motion is relatively complicated but analysis can be simplified by making a few assumptions. The analysis is further simplified by the use of two important conservation principles, the conservation of mass and conservation of energy. The law of conservation of mass gives us the equation of continuity while the law of conservation of energy is the basis of Bemoulli's equation.
