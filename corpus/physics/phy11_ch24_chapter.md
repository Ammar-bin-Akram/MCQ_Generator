We have already studied that a magnetic field is produced around a current-carrying conductor. Also, a changing magnetic field gives rise to a current in a conductor placed in it. Electromagnetism is a key area of physics that studies how electric charges and magnetic fields interact.
In 1820, Hans Christian Oersted found that electricity and magnetism are correlated.

## Magnetism started with todostone, a natural mineral discovered in ancient Törklyc. Lodestone, or magnetite $\left(\mathrm{Fe}_{3} \mathrm{O}_{4}\right)$, can attract metals like iron and steel and aligns with the Earth's magnetic poles, leading to the invention of the compass.

Electromagnetism is crucial for modern technology, including phones, computers, and medical devices. In this chapter, we will explore basic concepts like electric fields, magnetic forces, and electromagnetic induction, and see how these principles affect both natural phenomena and technology. Understanding these concepts help us appreciate how electromagnetism influences our world and drives innovation.

# 10.1 FORCE ON A CURRENT-CARRYING CONDUCTOR IN A UNIFORM MAGNETIC FIELD

It has been observed experimentally that a current-carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field experiences a force. Consider a straight conductor carrying a steady current placed perpendicular to uniform magnetic field. Assume the direction of the current is out of the paper as shown by $\oplus$ in Fig. 10.2. The direction of magnetic field produced by the current is also shown.
Just as two magnets exert forces on each other through their magnetic fields, a current-carrying conductor experiences a force due to the interaction between its own magnetic field and the external magnetic field. To determine the direction of this force, consider the interaction between the two fields.
Fig. 10.2

The magnetic field produced by the current and the external uniform magnetic field reinforce each other on the left side of the conductor and oppose each other on the right side. Consequently, the conductor moves towards the side where the field is weaker. That is, the force on the conductor is directed to the right as viewed from the front. Thus, the force $F$ is perpendicular to both the conductor and the magnetic field. Fleming's lefthand rule is used to predict the direction of the force experienced by a current-carrying conductor in a magneticfield. To apply the rule:

Position your left hand such that the first finger points in the direction of magnetic field, the second finger points in the direction of current, the thumb will then point in the direction of force.

The Fleming's left hand rule is illustrated in Fig. 10.3.
Fig. 10.3

However, direction of force can also be found by using right hand rule that can be stated as:

Curl fingers of your right hand from current to magnetic field through smaller angle, the stretched thumb will indicate the direction of force.

Let us now determine the magnitude of the force on a current-carrying conductor placed inside a magnetic field. Experimentally, it has been observed that the magnitude of the force acting on the conductor is directly proportional to the current $I$ in the conductor, the length $L$ of the conductor, and the strength of the external magnetic field $B$. The strength of the magnetic field is also known as the magnetic induction $B$, which has the same direction as the field. Thus, the force $F$ on a conductor of length $L$, carrying a current $I$ and placed perpendicular to a magnetic field of strength $B$, is given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
& F \propto B / L \\
& F=k B / L
\end{aligned}
$$

In SI units, the value of $k=1$. Therefore,

$$
F=B / L
$$

From Eq. (10.1) we can see that $B=\frac{F}{I L}$, so we can define $B$ as:
The magnetic strength is numerically equal to the force exerted on a conductor of length one metre carrying one ampere current, placed perpendicular to the magnetic field.
Equation $B=\frac{F}{I L}$ also gives us the unit of $B$. The SI unit of $B$ is tesla (T).

$$
1 \mathrm{~T}=1 \mathrm{NA}^{\prime \prime} \mathrm{m}^{\prime \prime}
$$

It may be noted that magnetic induction is a vector quantity. Its direction is the same as that of magnetic field.
We can also consider a vector $L$ which has a magnitude equal to the length of the conductor and its direction is along the flow of current.

Now consider a conductor $L$ placed at an angle ' $\theta$ ' w.r.t the magnetic field, then we will use the component of $L$ perpendicular to $B$ i.e., ( $L$ sin $\theta$ ), as shown in Fig. 10.4. Then the Eq. (10.1) will become,

$$
F=B / L \sin \theta
$$

In the vector form the Eq. 10.2 can be written as

$$
F=I L \times B
$$

Equation (10.2) shows that the force will be maximum (B/L) when the conductor is perpendicular to the field, i.e., $\theta=90^{\circ}$, and it will be zero when the conductor is along the field i.e., $\theta=0$.
The Earth's magnetic field is approximately that of a dipole, like that of the fictitious bar magnet, where the south magnetic pole is towards the geographic north pole and the north magnetic pole is towards the geographic south pole.

Example 10.1 A 20.0 cm wire carrying a current of 10.0 A is placed in a uniform magnetic field of 0.30 T . If the wire makes an angle of $40^{\circ}$ with the direction of magnetic field, find the magnitude of the force acting on the wire.

$$
\text { Solution Length of the wire }=L=20.0 \mathrm{~cm}=0.20 \mathrm{~m}
$$

| Physica III |  | (a) | Chaster 10 |  |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Current | $=1$ | $=10.0 \mathrm{~A}$ |  |  |
| Strength of magnetic field |  | $=B=0.30 \mathrm{~T}$ |  |  |
| Angle |  | $=9=40^{\circ}$ |  |  |

Substituting the values in Eq. (10.2): $\quad F=10.0 \mathrm{A} \times 0.30 \mathrm{~T} \times 0.20 \mathrm{~m} \times \sin 40^{\circ}=0.39 \mathrm{~N}$

# 10.2 MAGNETIC FLUX AND FLUX DENSITY

We can represent the strength of a magnetic field $B$ by the lines of force in the same way as for electric field. Then, the population of these lines in the field per unit area passing through a surface perpendicular to the field will represent the magnetic flux. Thus,
The magnetic flux through a patch of area $A$ is the number of magnetic lines passing through this area.
If $B$ represents the number of lines passing through unit area placed perpendicular to the field, then the total flux through area $A$ perpendicular to the field will be:

$$
B=\frac{\phi_{B}}{A}
$$

The surface $A$ may not be perpendicular to the field, that is the normal to the surface makes an angle $\theta$ with $B$ as shown in Fig. 10.5. Then, we will have to use component of $B$ (Bcos $\theta$ ) along the vector area $A$ (Fig. 10.6). Therefore, the flux passing through the surface will be:

$$
\phi_{B}=B A \cos \theta
$$

Fig. 10.5

As $B$ and $A$ both are vectors, so we can write

$$
\phi_{B}=B \cdot A
$$

Fig. 10.6

Equation (10.6) shows that $\phi_{B}$ is a scaler quantity. Therefore, we can define magnetic flux as:
The magnetic flux $\phi_{B}$, through a plane element of area A in a uniform magnetic field B is given by dot product of $B$ and $A$.

Note that $A$ is a vector whose magnitude is the area of the element and whose direction is along the normal to the surface of the element and $\theta$ is the angle between the directions of the vectors $B$ and $A$ (Fig. 10.5). In Fig. 10.7(a), the field is directed along the normal to the area, so $\theta$ is zero ( $\cos 0^{\circ}=1$ ) and the flux is maximum, equal to $B A$. When the field is parallel to the plane of the area (Fig. 10.7-b), the angle between the field and normal to area is $90^{\circ}$ i.e., $\theta=90^{\circ}\left(\cos 90^{\circ}=0\right)$, so the flux through the area in this orientation is zero.
Fig. 10.7

In case of a curved surface placed in a uniform magnetic field, the curved surface is divided into a number of small surface elements, each element being assumed plane and the flux through the whole curved surface is calculated by the sum of the contributions from all the elements of the surface using Eq.(10.5).
From the definition of tesla, the unit of magnetic flux is $\mathrm{N} \mathrm{m} \mathrm{A}^{-}$which is called weber (Wb). According to Eq. 10.5, the magnetic induction $B$ is the flux per unit area of a surface perpendicular to $B$, hence, it is also called as magnetic flux density. Its unit is Wb $\mathrm{m}^{-2}$. Therefore, magnetic induction, i.e. the magnetic field strength is measured in terms of $\mathrm{Wb} \mathrm{m}^{-2}$ or $\mathrm{NA}^{-1} \mathrm{~m}^{-1}$ (tesla).
Example 10.2 A rectangular loop of wire is placed in a uniform magnetic field of magnitude 1.2 T . If the loop is 25 cm long and 20 cm wide, determine the magnetic flux through the loop for the three orientations as shown in Fig. 10.8.

$$

\phi_{c} & =1.2 \mathrm{~T} \times 5 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~m}^{2} \times 0.866 \\
& =5.2 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~Wb}
\end{aligned}

# 10.3 MAGNETIC FLUX LINKAGE

Magnetic flux linkage is a key concept in electromagnetism, particularly in the study of inductance and electromagnetic induction. Magnetic flux linkage refers to the product of the magnetic flux through a coil and the number of turns in the coil. It essentially measures how much magnetic flux is linked with the coil due to its multiple turns, and is an important factor in understanding how coils and inductors operate in electrical circuits.
Magnetic flux linkage $=\phi=N \phi_{0} \ldots \ldots$ (10.7)
where $\phi_{0}$ is the magnetic flux through a single loop of area $A$ and $N$ is the total number of turns of the coil. Magnetic flux linkage plays a crucial role in the design and operation of transformers, electric motors, generators, and inductors. This concept is particularly important in Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, which we will explore later in this chapter.
A magnetic strip on the ATM card contains millions of tiny magnetic domains held together by a resin binder. The machine reads the information encoded on the magnetic strip and it makes your access to your account.

### 10.4 MOTION OF A CHARGED PARTICLE IN A MAGNETIC FIELD

We have observed that a current-carrying conductor placed perpendicularly in a uniform magnetic field experiences a force $F$. Since a current is the flow of electric charges, it raises the question: do individual charges moving through a magnetic field also experience a force? The answer is yes. Experiments show that a charged particle does experience a force when it moves across a magnetic field. We can calculate this force by examining the behaviour of a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field.
Consider a conductor of length $L$ through which $N$ charged particles, each with charge $q$, are passing in time $t$. The motion of these charged particles produces a current / in the conductor, which is given by

$$
i=\frac{Q}{t}=\frac{N q}{t}
$$

## Like electric field lines, magnetic field lines also never cross each other. However, they can attract or repel each other.
where $Q$ is the total charge flowing in time $t$. If $v$ is the velocity of charged particles, then the velocity of the particles along the conductor is

$$
\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{v} \mathbf{L}
$$

where $\mathbf{L}$ is the unit vector in the direction of the current. The sign of the force depends on whether the charge $q$ is positive or negative. However, the unit vector $\mathbf{L}$ is directed along the direction of the current, which is the direction of motion of positive charges.
Since the particles take time $t$ to move across the conductor of length $L$, therefore,
