While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:

- Musicians around the world have used protest songs to raise awareness about human rights violations.
- US folk singer Aunt Molly Jackson released the protest song "Poor Miner's Farewell" in 1932.
- It exposed the unlivable wages and dangerous working conditions coal miners faced in Kentucky during the 1920s and 1930s.
- South African singer-songwriter Hugh Masekela released the protest song "Bring Him Back Home" in 1987.
- It called on the South African government to free Nelson Mandela, an anti-apartheid leader who'd been unjustly imprisoned.

The student wants to contrast the song "Poor Miner's Farewell" with the song "Bring Him Back Home." Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?
A) The songs "Poor Miner's Farewell" and "Bring Him Back Home" both raised awareness about human rights violations.
B) While both are protest songs, "Poor Miner's Farewell" is about coal miners in Kentucky, whereas "Bring Him Back Home" is about the anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela.
C) Hugh Masekela's song "Bring Him Back Home," released in 1987, called on the South African government to free Nelson Mandela.
D) Released in 1932 by Aunt Molly Jackson, the song "Poor Miner's Farewell" was a protest against the unlivable wages and dangerous working conditions faced by Kentucky coal miners.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:

- Political scientist Graham Allison is known for his Thucydides trap theory.
- Allison's theory states that whenever "a rising power is threatening to displace a ruling power," conflict is likely.
- The theory is based on Thucydides's explanation of the conflict between Athens and Sparta.
- Thucydides wrote that "the rise of Athens and the fear this instilled in Sparta" made conflict "inevitable."
- History professor Edmund Stewart recently challenged the historical basis of the theory.
- Stewart claimed that Athens was not a rising power and that the rivals experienced a "clash of cultures" instead.

The student wants to use a quotation to challenge Thucydides's explanation of the conflict between Athens and Sparta. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?
A) According to Allison's Thucydides trap theory, whenever "a rising power is threatening to displace a ruling power," conflict is likely.
B) Thucydides wrote that conflict between the two powers was "inevitable," although Stewart later challenged the historical basis of this claim.
C) According to Stewart, a "clash of cultures" between Athens and Sparta caused the conflict, not Athens's rise.
D) Thucydides explained that conflict was caused by "the rise of Athens and the fear this instilled in Sparta," but Allison disagreed, seeing the conflict as an example of the Thucydides trap.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:

- Researchers in a 2021 study wanted to determine the rate at which 17 languages conveyed both information and syllables.
- They calculated the bits of information conveyed per second (the IR, or information rate).
- The IR was found to be approximately consistent across the 17 languages (an average of 39 bits per second).
- They calculated the number of syllables spoken per second (the SR, or syllable rate).
- Spanish had the second-fastest SR ( 7.7 syllables per second).
- Vietnamese had the sixteenth-fastest SR ( 5.3 syllables per second).

The student wants to present an overview of the study's findings. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?
A) The 2021 study determined the information rate (IR) of 17 languages in bits of information conveyed per second.
B) Researchers found that information was conveyed more quickly in Spanish, at 7.7 syllables per second, than in Vietnamese, at 5.3 syllables per second.
C) Vietnamese had the sixteenth-fastest syllable rate, lower than that of Spanish, which had the second-fastest; however, Spanish had the lower information rate of the two.
D) Though some of the languages differed in number of syllables spoken per second, all 17 conveyed information at roughly the same rate.

For example, Thomas's use of broken brushstrokes was inspired by the way that light would shine through the leaves of a tree in front of her house.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A) restricted
B) announced
C) distracted
D) influenced

In the 1990s, conservationists began planting more than 500,000 native trees in the habitat of the Azores bullfinch to boost the bird's numbers. This approach was apparently $\qquad$ : the Azores bullfinch's population size increased from as few as 100 birds at the end of the 1980s to around 1,300 in 2023.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A) amusing
B) costly
C) successful
D) disastrous

The recently observed gamma ray burst GRB 230307A lasted for 200 seconds, $\qquad$ for a burst generated by the merger of neutron stars. Bursts caused by neutron mergers typically last fewer than 2 seconds.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A) a coincidence
B) a reprieve
C) an incident
D) an oddity

In 1776, the United States sent Benjamin Franklin to France to try to win the country's support in the United States' fight for independence from Great Britain. Franklin was very popular in France. This $\qquad$ surely helped him to convince France to assist the United States.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
A) thoughtfulness

In the 1950s, scientists didn't know much about the ocean floor. Many scientists at the time believed that the ocean floor was mostly flat. But geologist Marie Tharp and her research partner, Bruce Heezen, proved that this idea was wrong. Using sonar data collected from the Atlantic Ocean, Tharp and Heezen showed that the floor was filled with canyons, mountains, and valleys.

Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?
A) It identifies a scientific belief that Tharp and Heezen showed to be wrong.
B) It describes the design of Tharp and Heezen's experiment.
C) It emphasizes a disagreement between Tharp and Heezen.
D) It presents data to support a claim that Tharp and Heezen made.

In the early days of television in the 1940s, many people thought that US television programs would rely on the financial support of ad agencies and commercial sponsors, much like radio did. But advertisers hesitated to jump into a new space, particularly at a time when the manufacturing of new television sets was stalled due to the US's involvement in World War II. Broadcasters, like the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), needed to persuade advertisers to support their programming despite not knowing whether there would be a robust television audience to begin with.

Which choice best describes the function of the underlined phrase in the text as a whole?
A) It compares the beginnings of radio programming with the beginnings of television programming in the United States.
B) It identifies a specific reason behind some advertisers' hesitance to support television.
C) It describes how broadcasters attempted to convince advertisers to support television.
D) It explains why a type of television programming was popular at the time.

The Bayeux Tapestry, from eleventh-century France, depicts 75 scenes over 250 feet of fabric. It was likely produced by workers embroidering in sections and then joining the resulting panels together. It's plausible that the workshop that produced the tapestry had never produced one so large, and some researchers claim that a close examination of the joins-the places where the panels are stitched together-suggests that the workers developed and refined their joining process over the course of production. For example, the first join the workers completed exhibits a clear misalignment of the borders of the two panels, whereas the later joins are virtually invisible.

Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?
A) It identifies the people and events depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry.
B) It supports an argument about the workers who produced the Bayeux Tapestry.
C) It compares the Bayeux Tapestry with other tapestries from eleventh-century France.
D) It describes how researchers determined where the Bayeux Tapestry was produced.

## Text 1

Little is known about how plate tectonics-wherein slabs of Earth's crust move over, under, away from, and against one another-began. Some researchers contend that tectonic movements began around 3 billion years ago, often noting that computer models of Earth's mantle temperature at the time indicate that the mantle would have been sufficiently molten to enable the plates to move.

## Text 2

Ultimately, any plausible claim about the inception of tectonic movement must rest on empirical evidence from the geological record. Researcher Wriju Chowdhury and his team analyzed the geochemistry of zircon crystals to gain insight into the chemical composition of the magma from which the crystals formed and, based on the data, compellingly argue that plate tectonics may have been occurring as early as 4.2 billion years ago.
Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to what "some researchers contend" as described in Text 1?
A) By suggesting that the temperature of Earth's mantle 3 billion years ago was likely insufficient to allow for the level of tectonic movement predicted by computer models
B) By distinguishing between computer models of Earth's mantle temperature that reliably predict the onset of plate tectonics and those that do not
C) By indicating that computer models of Earth's mantle temperature are still being improved such that new models tend to be much more reliable than their predecessors
D) By asserting that a more definitive form of evidence than the computer models suggests a different timeline for the onset of plate tectonics on Earth
