Hevea brasiliensis, a tree in the Amazon rainforest, is the world's main source of natural rubber. The tree produces a milky substance called latex that is used to make rubber. The bark of Hevea brasiliensis is helpful for the process of making rubber because it has a unique structure that makes it easy to collect latex. A network of tubes in the tree's inner bark helps the latex to flow out easily when people make small cuts into the bark.

What feature of Hevea brasiliensis does the text say is helpful for the process of making rubber?
A) Its latex produces rubber of an especially high quality.
B) Its bark has a unique structure that makes it easy to collect latex.
C) It is able to grow in a wide variety of climates around the world.
D) It is one of only two trees in the Amazon that produce latex.

Conservationists worldwide are working to protect ecosystems from habitat destruction and biodiversity loss, and in many cases, initiatives that rely on natural features or processes can help address such challenges. In response to a rapidly dwindling population of blueback salmon, the Quinault Indian Nation (a tribe in Washington State) partnered with the conservation organization Wild Salmon Center to restore naturally occurring logjams in the Quinault River. The logjams create shady pools where the blueback salmon can rest and spawn, thus promoting blueback population recovery.

Which choice best states the main idea of the text?
A) A partnership between the Quinault Indian Nation and Wild Salmon Center shows the importance of collaborative approaches to preserving biodiversity.
B) Nature-based approaches can be effective ways to achieve conservation goals.
C) As indicated by a recent project, logjams help the blueback salmon thrive and reproduce.
D) Scientists now realize that nature-based conservation methods offer better long-term solutions to environmental issues than methods that are not nature-based do.
