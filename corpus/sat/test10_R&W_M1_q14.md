O Pioneers! is a 1913 novel by Willa Cather. In the novel, Cather portrays Alexandra Bergson as having a deep emotional connection to her natural surroundings:

Which quotation from O Pioneers! most effectively illustrates the claim?
A) "She had never known before how much the country meant to her. The chirping of the insects down in the long grass had been like the sweetest music. She had felt as if her heart were hiding down there, somewhere, with the quail and the plover and all the little wild things that crooned or buzzed in the sun. Under the long shaggy ridges, she felt the future stirring."
B) "Alexandra talked to the men about their crops and to the women about their poultry. She spent a whole day with one young farmer who had been away at school, and who was experimenting with a new kind of clover hay. She learned a great deal."
C) "Alexandra drove off alone. The rattle of her wagon was lost in the howling of the wind, but her lantern, held firmly between her feet, made a moving point of light along the highway, going deeper and deeper into the dark country."
D) "It was Alexandra who read the papers and followed the markets, and who learned by the mistakes of their neighbors. It was Alexandra who could always tell about what it had cost to fatten each steer, and who could guess the weight of a hog before it went on the scales closer than John Bergson [her father] himself."

The novelist Toni Morrison was the first Black woman to work as an editor at the publishing company Random House, from 1967 to 1983. A scholar asserts that one of Morrison's likely aims during her time as an editor was to strengthen the presence of Black writers on the list of Random House's published authors.

Which finding, if true, would most strongly support the scholar's claim?
A) The percentage of authors published by Random House who were Black rose in the early 1970s and stabilized throughout the decade.
B) Black authors who were interviewed in the 1980s and 1990s were highly likely to cite Toni Morrison's novels as a principal influence on their work.
C) The novels written by Toni Morrison that were published after 1983 sold significantly more copies and received wider critical acclaim than the novels she wrote that were published before 1983.
D) Works that were edited by Toni Morrison during her time at Random House displayed stylistic characteristics that distinguished them from works that were not edited by Morrison.

Archaeologist Petra Vaiglova, anthropologist Xinyi Liu, and their colleagues investigated the domestication of farm animals in China during the Bronze Age (approximately 2000 to 1000 BCE). By analyzing the chemical composition of the bones of sheep, goats, and cattle from this era, the team determined that wild plants made up the bulk of sheep's and goats' diets, while the cattle's diet consisted largely of millet, a crop cultivated by humans. The team concluded that cattle were likely raised closer to human settlements, whereas sheep and goats were allowed to roam farther away.

Which finding, if true, would most strongly support the team's conclusion?
A) Analysis of the animal bones showed that the cattle's diet also consisted of wheat, which humans widely cultivated in China during the Bronze Age.
B) Further investigation of sheep and goat bones revealed that their diets consisted of small portions of millet as well.
C) Cattle's diets generally require larger amounts of food and a greater variety of nutrients than do sheep's and goats' diets.
D) The diets of sheep, goats, and cattle were found to vary based on what the farmers in each Bronze Age settlement could grow.

In a study of the evolution of DptA and DptB-Diptericin genes encoding antimicrobial peptides that combat pathogens and foster beneficial microbes in fruit flies (Drosophila)—researchers assessed Drosophila melanogaster resistance to pathogenic infections by Providencia rettgeri and Acetobacter sicerae, bacteria common in the flies' environments. Subjects included flies identified by mutations silencing DptA, DptB, or both DptA and DptB (termed types $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}$, and AB , respectively). In conjunction with the observation that resistance to $P$. rettgeri correlates with DptA activity but is not significantly affected by DptB activity, data in the graph of survival rates post-A. sicerae infection suggest that $\qquad$

Which completion of the text is best supported by data in the graph?
A) DptA confers defense against $A$. sicerae regardless of the presence of DptB.
B) DptB protects against only one bacteria species, whereas DptA protects against multiple species.
C) DptB may have developed as a specific defense against $A$. sicerae.
D) defense against $A$. sicerae is strongest when both DptA and DptB are present.

Euphorbia esula (leafy spurge) is a Eurasian plant that has become invasive in North America, where it displaces native vegetation and sickens cattle. E. esula can be controlled with chemical herbicides, but that approach can also kill harmless plants nearby. Recent research on introducing engineered DNA into plant species to inhibit their reproduction may offer a path toward exclusively targeting E. esula, consequently $\qquad$
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A) making individual E. esula plants more susceptible to existing chemical herbicides.
B) enhancing the ecological benefits of E. esula in North America.
C) enabling cattle to consume E. esula without becoming sick.
D) reducing invasive E. esula numbers without harming other organisms.

A team of biologists led by Jae-Hoon Jung, Antonio D. Barbosa, and Stephanie Hutin investigated the mechanism that allows Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress) plants to accelerate flowering at high temperatures. They replaced the protein ELF3 in the plants with a similar protein found in another species (stiff brome) that, unlike A. thaliana, displays no acceleration in flowering with increased temperature. A comparison of unmodified $A$. thaliana plants with the altered plants showed no difference in flowering at $22^{\circ}$ Celsius, but at $27^{\circ}$ Celsius, the unmodified plants exhibited accelerated flowering while the altered ones did not, which suggests that $\qquad$
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A) temperature-sensitive accelerated flowering is unique to $A$. thaliana.
B) A. thaliana increases ELF3 production as temperatures rise.
C) ELF3 enables A. thaliana to respond to increased temperatures.
D) temperatures of at least $22^{\circ}$ Celsius are required for $A$. thaliana to flower.

The Alvarez theory, developed in 1980 by physicist Luis Walter Alvarez and his geologist son Walter Alvarez, maintained that the secondary effects of an asteroid impact caused many dinosaurs and other animals to die $\qquad$ it left unexplored the question of whether unrelated volcanic activity might have also contributed to the mass extinctions.

D) out,

In winter, the diets of Japanese macaques, also known as snow monkeys, are influenced more by food availability than by food preference. Although the monkeys prefer to eat vegetation and land-dwelling invertebrates, those food sources may become unavailable because of extensive snow and ice cover, $\qquad$ the monkeys to hunt for marine animals in any streams that have not frozen over.

While many video game creators strive to make their graphics ever more $\qquad$ others look to the past, developing titles with visuals inspired by the " 8 -bit" games of the 1980s and 1990s. (The term " 8 -bit" refers to a console whose processor could only handle eight bits of data at once.)

The ghazal, a poetic form originating in seventh-century Arabic poetry, has an intricate structure.
