While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:

- The calendar used by most of the world (the Gregorian calendar) has 365 days.
- Because 365 days can't be divided evenly by 7 (the number of days in a week), calendar dates fall on a different day of the week each year.
- The Hanke-Henry permanent calendar, developed as an alternative to the Gregorian calendar, has 364 days.
- Because 364 can be divided evenly by 7 , calendar dates fall on the same day of the week each year, which supports more predictable scheduling.

The student wants to explain an advantage of the Hanke-Henry calendar. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?
A) The Gregorian calendar has 365 days, which is one day longer than the Hanke-Henry permanent calendar.
B) Adopting the Hanke-Henry permanent calendar would help solve a problem with the Gregorian calendar.
C) Designed so calendar dates would occur on the same day of the week each year, the Hanke-Henry calendar supports more predictable scheduling than does the Gregorian calendar.
D) The Hanke-Henry permanent calendar was developed as an alternative to the Gregorian calendar, which is currently the most-used calendar in the world.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:

- The Haudenosaunee Confederacy is a nearly 1,000-year-old alliance of six Native nations in the northeastern US.
- The members are bound by a centuries-old agreement known as the Great Law of Peace.
- Historian Bruce Johansen is one of several scholars who believe that the principles of the Great Law of Peace influenced the US Constitution.
- This theory is called the influence theory.
- Johansen cites the fact that Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson both studied the Haudenosaunee Confederacy.
The student wants to present the influence theory to an audience unfamiliar with the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?
A) Historian Bruce Johansen believes that the Great Law of Peace was very influential.
B) The influence theory is supported by the fact that Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson both studied the Haudenosaunee Confederacy.
C) The influence theory holds that the principles of the Great Law of Peace, a centuries-old agreement binding six Native nations in the northeastern US, influenced the US Constitution.
