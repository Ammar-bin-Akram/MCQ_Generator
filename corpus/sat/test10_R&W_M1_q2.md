The following text is adapted from Pam Muñoz Ryan's 2020 novel Mañanaland. In the village where Max lives, there is an old fortress called La Reina. Children in the village say that the fortress is haunted.

For as long as he could remember, Max had begged Papá [his father] to take him to see La Reina and the ruins up close. He'd be a hero among his friends if he was the first boy to cross the haunted gates! Just because Papá didn't believe in ghosts didn't mean they weren't there. Maybe this summer Papá would finally take him. He was almost twelve.

The following text is from Charlotte Forten Grimké's 1888 poem "At Newport."

Oh, deep delight to watch the gladsome waves Exultant leap upon the rugged rocks; Ever repulsed, yet ever rushing onFilled with a life that will not know defeat; To see the glorious hues of sky and sea. The distant snowy sails, glide spirit like, Into an unknown world, to feel the sweet Enchantment of the sea thrill all the soul, Clearing the clouded brain, making the heart Leap joyous as it own bright, singing waves!

Believing that living in an impractical space can heighten awareness and even improve health, conceptual artists Madeline Gins and Shusaku Arakawa designed an apartment building in Japan to be more fanciful than functional. A kitchen counter is chest-high on one side and knee-high on the other; a ceiling has a door to nowhere. The effect is disorienting but invigorating: after four years there, filmmaker Nobu Yamaoka reported significant health benefits.

Which choice best states the main idea of the text?
A) Although inhabiting a home surrounded by fanciful features such as those designed by Gins and Arakawa can be rejuvenating, it is unsustainable.
B) Designing disorienting spaces like those in the Gins and Arakawa building is the most effective way to create a physically stimulating environment.
C) As a filmmaker, Yamaoka has long supported the designs of conceptual artists such as Gins and Arakawa.
D) Although impractical, the design of the apartment building by Gins and Arakawa may improve the well-being of the building's residents.

The following text is adapted from Lewis Carroll's 1889 satirical novel Sylvie and Bruno. A crowd has gathered outside a room belonging to the Warden, an official who reports to the Lord Chancellor.

One man, who was more excited than the rest, flung his hat high into the air, and shouted (as well as I could make out) "Who roar for the Sub-Warden?" Everybody roared, but whether it was for the Sub-Warden, or not, did not clearly appear: some were shouting "Bread!" and some "Taxes!", but no one seemed to know what it was they really wanted.

All this I saw from the open window of the Warden's breakfast-saloon, looking across the shoulder of the Lord Chancellor.
"What can it all mean?" he kept repeating to himself. "I never heard such shouting before-and at this time of the morning, too! And with such unanimity!"

Based on the text, how does the Lord Chancellor respond to the crowd?
A) He asks about the meaning of the crowd's shouting, even though he claims to know what the crowd wants.
B) He indicates a desire to speak to the crowd, even though the crowd has asked to speak to the Sub-Warden.
C) He expresses sympathy for the crowd's demands, even though the crowd's shouting annoys him.
D) He describes the crowd as being united, even though the crowd clearly appears otherwise.

Number and Origin of Clamshell Tools Found at Different Levels Below the Surface in Neanderthal Cave

| Depth of tools found below <br> surface in cave (meters) | Clamshells that Neanderthals <br> collected from the beach | Clamshells that Neanderthals <br> harvested from the seafloor |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| $3-4$ | 99 | 33 |
| $6-7$ | 1 | 0 |
| $4-5$ | 2 | 0 |
| $2-3$ | 7 | 0 |
| $5-6$ | 18 | 7 |

Studying tools unearthed at a cave site on the western coast of Italy, archaeologist Paola Villa and colleagues have determined that prehistoric Neanderthal groups fashioned them from shells of clams that they harvested from the seafloor while wading or diving or that washed up on the beach. Clamshells become thin and eroded as they wash up on the beach, while those on the seafloor are smooth and sturdy, so the research team suspects that Neanderthals prized the tools made with seafloor shells. However, the team also concluded that those tools were likely more challenging to obtain, noting that $\qquad$
Which choice most effectively uses data from the table to support the research team's conclusion?
A) at each depth below the surface in the cave, the difference in the numbers of tools of each type suggests that shells were easier to collect from the beach than to harvest from the seafloor.
B) the highest number of tools were at a depth of 3-4 meters below the surface, which suggests that the Neanderthal population at the site was highest during the related period of time.
C) at each depth below the surface in the cave, the difference in the numbers of tools of each type suggests that Neanderthals preferred to use clamshells from the beach because of their durability.
D) the higher number of tools at depths of 5-6 meters below the surface in the cave than at depths of 4-5 meters below the surface suggests that the size of clam populations changed over time.

Perovskite solar cells convert light into electricity more efficiently than earlier kinds of solar cells, and manufacturing advances have recently made them commercially attractive. One limitation of the cells, however, has to do with their electron transport layer (ETL), through which absorbed electrons must pass. Often the ETL is applied through a process called spin coating, but such ETLs are fairly inefficient at converting input power to output power. André Taylor and colleagues tested a novel spray coating method for applying the ETL. The team produced ETLs of various thicknesses and concluded that spray coating holds promise for improving the power conversion efficiency of ETLs in perovskite solar cells.

Which choice best describes data from the graph that support Taylor and colleagues' conclusion?
A) Both the ETL applied through spin coating and the ETL applied through spray coating showed a power conversion efficiency greater than $10 \%$ at their lowest performing thickness.
B) The lowest performing ETL applied through spray coating had a higher power conversion efficiency than the highest performing ETL applied through spin coating.
C) The highest performing ETL applied through spray coating showed a power conversion efficiency of approximately $13 \%$, while the highest performing ETL applied through spin coating showed a power conversion efficiency of approximately $11 \%$.
D) There was a substantial difference in power conversion efficiency between the lowest and highest performing ETLs applied through spray coating.

The linguistic niche hypothesis (LNH) posits that the exotericity of languages (how prevalent non-native speakers are) and grammatical complexity are inversely related, which the LNH ascribes to attrition of complex grammatical rules as more non-native speakers adopt the language but fail to acquire those rules. Focusing on two characteristics that are positive indices of grammatical complexity, fusion (when new phonemes arise from the merger of previously distinct ones) and informativity (languages' capacity for meaningful variation), Olena Shcherbakova and colleagues conducted a quantitative analysis for more than 1,300 languages and claim the outcome is inconsistent with the LNH.
Which finding, if true, would most directly support Shcherbakova and colleagues' claim?
A) Shcherbakova and colleagues' analysis showed a slightly negative correlation between grammatical complexity and fusion and between grammatical complexity and informativity.
B) Shcherbakova and colleagues' analysis showed a slightly negative correlation between grammatical complexity and exotericity.
C) Shcherbakova and colleagues' analysis showed a slightly positive correlation between grammatical complexity and fusion.
D) Shcherbakova and colleagues' analysis showed a slightly positive correlation between fusion and exotericity and between informativity and exotericity.

Archaeologist Christiana Kohler and her team excavated the Egyptian tomb of Queen Merneith, the wife of a First Dynasty pharaoh. Some scholars claim that she also ruled Egypt on her own and was actually the first female pharaoh. The team found a tablet in Merneith's tomb with writing suggesting that she was in charge of the country's treasury and other central offices. Whether Merneith was a pharaoh or not, this discovery supports the idea that Merneith likely $\qquad$
Which choice most logically completes the text?
