The following text is adapted from Gwendolyn Bennett's 1926 poem "Street Lamps in Early Spring."

Night wears a garment
All velvet soft, all violet blue...
And over her face she draws a veil
As shimmering fine as floating dew...
And here and there
In the black of her hair
The subtle hands of Night
Move slowly with their gem-starred light.

The following text is adapted from Jane Austen's 1814 novel Mansfield Park. The speaker, Tom, is considering staging a play at home with a group of his friends and family.

We mean nothing but a little amusement among ourselves, just to vary the scene, and exercise our powers in something new. We want no audience, no publicity. We may be trusted, I think, in choosing some play most perfectly unexceptionable; and I can conceive no greater harm or danger to any of us in conversing in the elegant written language of some respectable author than in chattering in words of our own.

Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?
A) To offer Tom's assurance that the play will be inoffensive and involve only a small number of people
B) To clarify that the play will not be performed in the manner Tom had originally intended
C) To elaborate on the idea that the people around Tom lack the skills to successfully stage a play
D) To assert that Tom believes the group performing the play will be able to successfully promote it
