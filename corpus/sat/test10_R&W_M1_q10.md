## Text 1

Astronomer Mark Holland and colleagues examined four white dwarfs-small, dense remnants of past stars-in order to determine the composition of exoplanets that used to orbit those stars. Studying wavelengths of light in the white dwarf atmospheres, the team reported that traces of elements such as lithium and sodium support the presence of exoplanets with continental crusts similar to Earth's.

## Text 2

Past studies of white dwarf atmospheres have concluded that certain exoplanets had continental crusts. Geologist Keith Putirka and astronomer Siyi Xu argue that those studies unduly emphasize atmospheric traces of lithium and other individual elements as signifiers of the types of rock found on Earth. The studies don't adequately account for different minerals made up of various ratios of those elements, and the possibility of rock types not found on Earth that contain those minerals.

Based on the texts, how would Putirka and Xu (Text 2) most likely characterize the conclusion presented in Text 1?
A) As unexpected, because it was widely believed at the time that white dwarf exoplanets lack continental crusts
B) As premature, because researchers have only just begun trying to determine what kinds of crusts white dwarf exoplanets had
C) As questionable, because it rests on an incomplete consideration of potential sources of the elements detected in white dwarf atmospheres
D) As puzzling, because it's unusual to successfully detect lithium and sodium when analyzing wavelengths of light in white dwarf atmospheres

The following text is from David Barclay Moore's 2022 novel Holler of the Fireflies. The narrator has just arrived at summer camp, which is far away from his home.

This place was different than I thought it would be. I'd never been somewhere like this before. I did feel scared, but also excited.

The following text is adapted from Oscar Wilde's 1891 novel The Picture of Dorian Gray. Dorian Gray is taking his first look at a portrait that Hallward has painted of him.

Dorian passed listlessly in front of his picture and turned towards it. When he saw it he drew back, and his cheeks flushed for a moment with pleasure. A look of joy came into his eyes, as if he had recognized himself for the first time. He stood there motionless and in wonder, dimly conscious that Hallward was speaking to him, but not catching the meaning of his words. The sense of his own beauty came on him like a revelation. He had never felt it before.

According to the text, what is true about Dorian?
A) He wants to know Hallward's opinion of the portrait.
B) He is delighted by what he sees in the portrait.
C) He prefers portraits to other types of paintings.
D) He is uncertain of Hallward's talent as an artist.
