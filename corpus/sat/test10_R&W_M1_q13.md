Choctaw/Cherokee artist Jeffrey Gibson turns punching bags used by boxers into art by decorating them with beadwork and elements of Native dressmaking. These elements include leather fringe and jingles, the metal cones that cover the dresses worn in the jingle dance, a women's dance of the Ojibwe people. Thus, Gibson combines an object commonly associated with masculinity (a punching bag) with art forms traditionally practiced by women in most Native communities (beadwork and dressmaking). In this way, he rejects the division of male and female gender roles.

Which choice best describes Gibson's approach to art, as presented in the text?
A) He draws from traditional Native art forms to create his original works.
B) He has been influenced by Native and non-Native artists equally.
C) He finds inspiration from boxing in designing the dresses he makes.
D) He rejects expectations about color and pattern when incorporating beadwork.
