The following text is adapted from Frances Hodgson Burnett's 1911 novel The Secret Garden. Mary, a young girl, recently found an overgrown hidden garden.

Mary was an odd, determined little person, and now she had something interesting to be determined about, she was very much absorbed, indeed. She worked and dug and pulled up weeds steadily, only becoming more pleased with her work every hour instead of tiring of it. It seemed to her like a fascinating sort of play.

Which choice best states the main idea of the text?
A) Mary hides in the garden to avoid doing her chores.
B) Mary is getting bored with pulling up so many weeds in the garden.
C) Mary is clearing out the garden to create a space to play.
D) Mary feels very satisfied when she's taking care of the garden.

The following text is from Ezra Pound's 1909 poem "Hymn III," based on the work of Marcantonio Flaminio.

As a fragile and lovely flower unfolds its gleaming foliage on the breast of the fostering earth, if the dew and the rain draw it forth;
So doth my tender mind flourish, if it be fed with the sweet dew of the fostering spirit,
Lacking this, it beginneth straightway to languish, even as a floweret born upon dry earth, if the dew and the rain tend it not.

Based on the text, in what way is the human mind like a flower?
A) It becomes increasingly vigorous with the passage of time.
B) It draws strength from changes in the weather.
C) It requires proper nourishment in order to thrive.
D) It perseveres despite challenging circumstances.

The following text is adapted from Jack London's 1903 novel The Call of the Wild. Buck is a sled dog living with John Thornton in Yukon, Canada.

Thornton alone held [Buck]. The rest of mankind was as nothing. Chance travellers might praise or pet him; but he was cold under it all, and from a too demonstrative man he would get up and walk away. When Thornton's partners, Hans and Pete, arrived on the long-expected raft, Buck refused to notice them till he learned they were close to Thornton; after that he tolerated them in a passive sort of way, accepting favors from them as though he favored them by accepting.

Which choice best states the main idea of the text?
A) Buck has become less social since he began living with Thornton.
B) Buck mistrusts humans and does his best to avoid them.
C) Buck has been especially well liked by most of Thornton's friends.
D) Buck holds Thornton in higher regard than any other person.

Organic farming is a method of growing food that tries to reduce environmental harm by using natural forms of pest control and avoiding fertilizers made with synthetic materials. Organic farms are still a small fraction of the total farms in the United States, but they have been becoming more popular. According to the US Department of Agriculture, in 2016 California had between 2,600 and 2,800 organic farms and $\qquad$
Which choice most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the text?
A) Washington had between 600 and 800 organic farms.
B) New York had fewer than 800 organic farms.
C) Wisconsin and Iowa each had between 1,200 and 1,400 organic farms.
D) Pennsylvania had more than 1,200 organic farms.

Biologist Valentina Gómez-Bahamón and her team have investigated two subspecies of the fork-tailed flycatcher bird that live in the same region in Colombia, but one subspecies migrates south for part of the year, and the other doesn't. The researchers found that, due to slight differences in feather shape, the feathers of migratory forked-tailed flycatcher males make a sound during flight that is higher pitched than that made by the feathers of nonmigratory males. The researchers hypothesize that fork-tailed flycatcher females are attracted to the specific sound made by the males of their own subspecies, and that over time the females' preference will drive further genetic and anatomical divergence between the subspecies.

Which finding, if true, would most directly support Gómez-Bahamón and her team's hypothesis?
A) The feathers located on the wings of the migratory fork-tailed flycatchers have a narrower shape than those of the nonmigratory birds, which allows them to fly long distances.
B) Over several generations, the sound made by the feathers of migratory male fork-tailed flycatchers grows progressively higher pitched relative to that made by the feathers of nonmigratory males.
C) Fork-tailed flycatchers communicate different messages to each other depending on whether their feathers create high-pitched or low-pitched sounds.
D) The breeding habits of the migratory and nonmigratory fork-tailed flycatchers remained generally the same over several generations.

Ablation Rates for Three Elements in Cosmic Dust, by Dust Source

| Element | SPC | AST | HTC | OCC |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| iron | $20 \%$ | $28 \%$ | $90 \%$ | $98 \%$ |
| potassium | $44 \%$ | $74 \%$ | $97 \%$ | $100 \%$ |
| sodium | $45 \%$ | $75 \%$ | $99 \%$ | $100 \%$ |

Earth's atmosphere is bombarded by cosmic dust originating from several sources: short-period comets (SPCs), particles from the asteroid belt (ASTs), Halley-type comets (HTCs), and Oort cloud comets (OCCs). Some of the dust's material vaporizes in the atmosphere in a process called ablation, and the faster the particles move, the higher the rate of ablation. Astrophysicist Juan Diego Carrillo-Sánchez led a team that calculated average ablation rates for elements in the dust (such as iron and potassium) and showed that material in slowermoving SPC or AST dust has a lower rate than the same material in faster-moving HTC or OCC dust. For example, whereas the average ablation rate for iron from AST dust is $28 \%$, the average rate for $\qquad$
Which choice most effectively uses data from the table to complete the example?
A) iron from SPC dust is $20 \%$.
B) sodium from OCC dust is $100 \%$.
C) iron from HTC dust is $90 \%$.
D) sodium from AST dust is $75 \%$.

Art collectives, like the United States- and Vietnambased collective The Propeller Group or Cuba's Los Carpinteros, are groups of artists who agree to work together: perhaps for stylistic reasons, or to advance certain shared political ideals, or to help mitigate the costs of supplies and studio space. Regardless of the reasons, art collectives usually involve some collaboration among the artists. Based on a recent series of interviews with various art collectives, an arts journalist claims that this can be difficult for artists who are often used to having sole control over their work.

Which quotation from the interviews best illustrates the journalist's claim?
A) "The first collective I joined included many amazingly talented artists, and we enjoyed each other's company, but because we had a hard time sharing credit and responsibility for our work, the collective didn't last."
B) "We work together, but that doesn't mean that individual projects are equally the work of all of us. Many of our projects are primarily the responsibility of whoever originally proposed the work to the group."
C) "Having worked as a member of a collective for several years, it's sometimes hard to recall what it was like to work alone without the collective's support. But that support encourages my individual expression rather than limits it."
D) "Sometimes an artist from outside the collective will choose to collaborate with us on a project, but all of those projects fit within the larger themes of the work the collective does on its own."

Effects of Mycorrhizal Fungi on 3 Plant Species

| Plant <br> species | Mycorrhizal <br> host | Average mass of plants <br> grown in soil containing <br> mycorrhizal fungi <br> (in grams) | Average mass of plants <br> grown in soil treated <br> to kill fungi (in grams) |
| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Corn | yes | 15.1 | 3.8 |
| Marigold | yes | 10.2 | 2.4 |
| Broccoli | no | 7.5 | 7 |

Mycorrhizal fungi in soil benefits many plants, substantially increasing the mass of some. A student conducted an experiment to illustrate this effect. The student chose three plant species for the experiment, including two that are mycorrhizal hosts (species known to benefit from mycorrhizal fungi) and one nonmycorrhizal species (a species that doesn't benefit from and may even be harmed by mycorrhizal fungi). The student then grew several plants from each species both in soil containing mycorrhizal fungi and in soil that had been treated to kill mycorrhizal and other fungi. After several weeks, the student measured the plants' average mass and was surprised to discover that $\qquad$
Which choice most effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement?
A) broccoli grown in soil containing mycorrhizal fungi had a slightly higher average mass than broccoli grown in soil that had been treated to kill fungi.
B) corn grown in soil containing mycorrhizal fungi had a higher average mass than broccoli grown in soil containing mycorrhizal fungi.
C) marigolds grown in soil containing mycorrhizal fungi had a much higher average mass than marigolds grown in soil that had been treated to kill fungi.
D) corn had the highest average mass of all three species grown in soil that had been treated to kill fungi, while marigolds had the lowest.

Several artworks found among the ruins of the ancient Roman city of Pompeii depict a female figure fishing with a cupid nearby. Some scholars have asserted that the figure is the goddess Venus, since she is known to have been linked with cupids in Roman culture, but University of Leicester archaeologist Carla Brain suggests that cupids may have also been associated with fishing generally. The fact that a cupid is shown near the female figure, therefore, $\qquad$
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A) is not conclusive evidence that the figure is Venus.
B) suggests that Venus was often depicted fishing.
C) eliminates the possibility that the figure is Venus.
D) would be difficult to account for if the figure is not Venus.
