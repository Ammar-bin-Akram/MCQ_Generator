The domestic sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) descends from a wild plant native to South America. It also populates the Polynesian Islands, where evidence confirms that Native Hawaiians and other Indigenous peoples were cultivating the plant centuries before seafaring first occurred over the thousands of miles of ocean separating them from South America. To explain how the sweet potato was first introduced in Polynesia, botanist Pablo Muñoz-Rodríguez and colleagues analyzed the DNA of numerous varieties of the plant, concluding that Polynesian varieties diverged from South American ones over 100,000 years ago. Given that Polynesia was peopled only in the last three thousand years, the team concluded that $\qquad$
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A) the cultivation of the sweet potato in Polynesia likely predates its cultivation in South America.
B) Polynesian peoples likely acquired the sweet potato from South American peoples only within the last three thousand years.
C) human activity likely played no role in the introduction of the sweet potato in Polynesia.
D) Polynesian sweet potato varieties likely descend from a single South American variety that was domesticated, not wild.

The morphological novelty of echinoderms-marine invertebrates with radial symmetry, usually starlike, around a central point-impedes comparisons with most other animals, in which bilateral symmetry on an anterior-posterior (head to tail) axis through a trunk is typical. Particularly puzzling are sea stars, thought to have evolved a headless layout from a known bilateral origin. Applying genomic knowledge of Saccoglossus kowalevskii acorn worms (close relatives of sea stars, and thus expected to have similar markers for corresponding anatomical regions) to the body patterning genes of Patiria miniata sea stars, Laurent Formery et al. observed activity only in anterior genes across $P$. miniata's entire body and some posterior genes limited to the edges, suggesting that $\qquad$
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A) despite the greater prevalence of anterior genes in sea stars' genetic makeup, posterior genes active at the body's perimeter are primarily responsible for the starlike layout that distinguishes sea stars' radial symmetry from that of other echinoderms.
B) contrary to the belief that they evolved from early ancestors with the bilateral form typical of many other animals, sea stars instead originated with an atypical body layout that was neither bilaterally nor radially symmetrical.
C) although the two species are closely related, there is only minimal correspondence in the genetic markers for head, tail, and trunk region development in P. miniata sea stars and S. kowalevskii acorn worms.
D) rather than undergoing changes resulting in the eventual elimination of a head region in their radial body plan, as previously assumed, sea stars' morphology evolved to completely lack a trunk and consist primarily of a head region.

To survive when water is scarce, embryos inside African turquoise killifish eggs $\qquad$ a dormant state known as diapause. In this state, embryonic development is paused for as long as two years-longer than the life span of an adult killifish.
