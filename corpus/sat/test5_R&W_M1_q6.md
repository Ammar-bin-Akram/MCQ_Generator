The following text is adapted from Jean Webster's 1912 novel Daddy-Long-Legs. The narrator is a young college student writing letters detailing her weekly experiences.
[The college is] organizing the Freshman basket-ball team and there's just a chance that I shall make it. I'm little of course, but terribly quick and wiry and tough. While the others are hopping about in the air, I can dodge under their feet and grab the ball.

Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?
A) To compare basketball with other sports
B) To provide details of how to play basketball
C) To state how players will be chosen for the basketball team
D) To explain why the narrator thinks she might make the basketball team

In the late 1800s, Spanish-language newspapers flourished in cities across Texas. San Antonio alone produced eleven newspapers in Spanish between 1890 and 1900. But El Paso surpassed all other cities in the state. This city produced twenty-two newspapers in Spanish during that period. El Paso is located on the border with Mexico and has always had a large population of Spanish speakers. Thus, it is unsurprising that this city became such a rich site for Spanish-language journalism.

Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?
A) To compare Spanish-language newspapers published in Texas today with ones published there during the late 1800s
B) To explain that Spanish-language newspapers thrived in Texas and especially in El Paso during the late 1800s
C) To argue that Spanish-language newspapers published in El Paso influenced the ones published in San Antonio during the late 1800s
D) To explain why Spanish-language newspapers published in Texas were so popular in Mexico during the late 1800s

Chile's Atacama Desert is one of the driest places on Earth. Mary Beth Wilhelm and other astrobiologists search for life, or its remains, in this harsh place because the desert closely mirrors the extreme environment on Mars. The algae and bacteria found in Atacama's driest regions may offer clues about Martian life. By studying how these and other microorganisms survive such extreme conditions on Earth, Wilhelm's team hopes to determine whether similar life might have existed on Mars and to develop the best tools to look for evidence of it.

Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?
A) To contrast the conditions in the Atacama Desert with those on Mars
B) To explain why many life-forms cannot survive in the Atacama Desert
C) To indicate why astrobiologists choose to conduct research in the Atacama Desert
D) To describe certain limitations to conducting scientific study in the Atacama Desert

More than $60 \%$ of journeys in Mexico City occur via public transit, but simply reproducing a feature of the city's transit system-e.g., its low fares-is unlikely to induce a significant increase in another city's transit ridership. As Erick Guerra et al. have shown, transportation mode choice in urban areas of Mexico is the product of a complex mix of factors, including population density, the spatial distribution of jobs, and demographic characteristics of individuals. System features do affect ridership, of course, but there is an irreducibly contextual dimension of transportation mode choice.
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?
A) It presents an objection to the argument of Guerra et al. about transportation mode choice in urban areas of Mexico.
B) It explains why it is challenging to influence transit ridership solely by altering characteristics of a transit system.
C) It illustrates the claim that a characteristic associated with high transit ridership in Mexico City is not associated with high transit ridership elsewhere.
D) It substantiates the assertion that population density, the spatial distribution of jobs, and demographic characteristics are important factors in transportation mode choice.
