While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:

- Most, but not all, of the Moon's oxygen comes from the Sun, via solar wind.
- Cosmochemist Kentaro Terada from Osaka University wondered if some of the unaccounted-for oxygen could be coming from Earth.
- In 2008, he analyzed data from the Japanese satellite Kaguya.
- Kaguya gathered data about gases and particles it encountered while orbiting the Moon.
- Based on the Kaguya data, Terada confirmed his suspicion that Earth is sending oxygen to the Moon.

The student wants to emphasize the aim of the research study. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?
A) As it orbited the Moon, the Kaguya satellite collected data that was later analyzed by cosmochemist Kentaro Terada.
B) Before 2008, Kentaro Terada wondered if the Moon was receiving some of its oxygen from Earth.
C) Cosmochemist Kentaro Terada set out to determine whether some of the Moon's oxygen was coming from Earth.
D) Kentaro Terada's study determined that Earth is sending a small amount of oxygen to the Moon.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:

- The factors that affect clutch size (the number of eggs laid at one time) have been well studied in birds but not in lizards.
- A team led by Shai Meiri of Tel Aviv University investigated which factors influence lizard clutch size.
- Meiri's team obtained clutch-size and habitat data for over 3,900 lizard species and analyzed the data with statistical models.
- Larger clutch size was associated with environments in higher latitudes that have more seasonal change.
- Lizards in higher-latitude environments may lay larger clutches to take advantage of shorter windows of favorable conditions.

The student wants to emphasize the aim of the research study. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?
A) Researchers wanted to know which factors influence lizard egg clutch size because such factors have been well studied in birds but not in lizards.
B) After they obtained data for over 3,900 lizard species, researchers determined that larger clutch size was associated with environments in higher latitudes that have more seasonal change.
C) We now know that lizards in higher-latitude environments may lay larger clutches to take advantage of shorter windows of favorable conditions.
D) Researchers obtained clutch-size and habitat data for over 3,900 lizard species and analyzed the data with statistical models.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:

- British musicians John Lennon and Paul McCartney shared writing credit for numerous Beatles songs.
- Many Lennon-McCartney songs were actually written by either Lennon or McCartney, not by both.
- The exact authorship of specific parts of many Beatles songs, such as the verse for "In My Life," is disputed.
- Mark Glickman, Jason Brown, and Ryan Song used statistical methods to analyze the musical content of Beatles songs.
- They concluded that there is $18.9 \%$ probability that McCartney wrote the verse for "In My Life," stating that the verse is "consistent with Lennon's songwriting style."

The student wants to make a generalization about the kind of study conducted by Glickman, Brown, and Song. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?
A) Based on statistical analysis, Glickman, Brown, and Song claim that John Lennon wrote the verse of "In My Life."
B) There is only an $18.9 \%$ probability that Paul McCartney wrote the verse for "In My Life"; John Lennon is the more likely author.
C) It is likely that John Lennon, not Paul McCartney, wrote the verse for "In My Life."
D) Researchers have used statistical methods to address questions of authorship within the field of music.
