Some astronomers searching for extraterrestrial life have proposed that atmospheric $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ (ammonia) can serve as a biosignature gas-an indication that a planet harbors life. Jingcheng Huang, Sara Seager, and colleagues evaluated this possibility, finding that on rocky planets, atmospheric $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ likely couldn't reach detectably high levels in the absence of biological activity. But the team also found that on so-called mini-Neptunes-gas planets smaller than Neptune but with atmospheres similar to Neptune's-atmospheric pressure and temperature can be high enough to produce atmospheric $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$.

Based on the text, Huang, Seager, and colleagues would most likely agree with which statement about atmospheric $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ ?
A) Its presence is more likely to indicate that a planet is a mini-Neptune than that the planet is a rocky planet that could support life.
B) Its absence from a planet that's not a mini-Neptune indicates that the planet probably doesn't have life.
C) It should be treated as a biosignature gas if detected in the atmosphere of a rocky planet but not if detected in the atmosphere of a mini-Neptune.
D) It doesn't reliably reach high enough concentrations in the atmospheres of rocky planets or mini-Neptunes to be treated as a biosignature gas.

In 2021, four of the United States national parks that were among the most visited were Grand Canyon National Park, Rocky Mountain National Park, Yellowstone National Park, and Zion National Park. The graph shows the number of visits for recreation to each of these parks during the three-month period with the highest number of visitors. A student notes that among the parks shown in the graph, the park with the highest monthly recreation visits in all three months was $\qquad$
