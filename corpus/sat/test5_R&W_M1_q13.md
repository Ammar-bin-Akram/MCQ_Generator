"The Bet" is an 1889 short story by Anton Chekhov. In the story, a banker is described as being very upset about something:

Which quotation from "The Bet" most effectively illustrates the claim?
A) "Then the banker cautiously broke the seals off the door and put the key in the keyhole."
B) "It struck three o'clock, the banker listened; everyone was asleep in the house and nothing could be heard outside but the rustling of the chilled trees."
C) "The banker, spoilt and frivolous, with millions beyond his reckoning, was delighted at the bet."
D) "When [the banker] got home he lay on his bed, but his tears and emotion kept him for hours from sleeping."

| Partial List of Candidate Species for De-extinction |  |  |
| :-- | :-- | :--: |
| Common name | Scientific name | Became extinct |
|  | Heteralocha <br> acutirostris | 1907 |
| Caribbean <br> monk seal | Monachus <br> tropicalis | 1952 |
| Passenger <br> pigeon | Ectopistes <br> migratorius | 1914 |
| Saber-toothed <br> cat | Smilodon | 11,000 years <br> before present |
| Woolly <br> mammoth | Mammuthus <br> primigenius | 6,400 years <br> before present |

The passage of time is among the many obstacles faced by scientists who are pursuing de-extinction efforts-that is, efforts to use breeding or a mixture of cloning and genetic engineering to bring back extinct species. Specifically, researchers are concerned that the longer a species has been extinct, the less likely it is that a suitable habitat still exists for that species. Among candidate species for de-extinction, this problem would be especially concerning for the $\qquad$
Which choice most effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement?
A) passenger pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius), which became extinct only a few years after the huia (Heteralocha acutirostris).
B) saber-toothed cat (Smilodon), which became extinct 11,000 years ago.
C) woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius), which became extinct several thousand years before the saber-toothed cat (Smilodon).
D) Caribbean monk seal (Monachus tropicalis), which became extinct in 1952.

"The Yellow Wallpaper" is an 1892 short story by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. In the story, the narrator expresses mixed feelings about her surroundings:

Which quotation from "The Yellow Wallpaper" most effectively illustrates the claim?
A) "This wallpaper has a kind of sub-pattern in a different shade, a particularly irritating one, for you can only see it in certain lights, and not clearly then."
B) "By moonlight-the moon shines in all night when there is a moon-I wouldn't know it was the same paper."
C) "I'm really getting quite fond of the big room, all but that horrid [wall] paper."
D) "The color is repellant, almost revolting; a smouldering, unclean yellow, strangely faded by the slow-turning sunlight."

The population of the coral Lophelia pertusa declined significantly around 9,000 years ago in the Alboran Sea and around 11,000 years ago near the Mauritanian coast. Using the ratio of manganese to calcium, which inversely correlates with ocean oxygenation levels, marine scientist Rodrigo da Costa Portilho-Ramos and colleagues evaluated whether oxygenation played a role in the declines of L. pertusa. The researchers concluded that oxygenation may have been important in the Alboran Sea but not near the Mauritanian coast, since $\qquad$

Which choice most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the statement?
A) a substantial increase in oxygenation in the Alboran Sea corresponded with the local decline in L. pertusa, but the opposite relationship between oxygenation and L. pertusa was found near the Mauritanian coast.
B) L. pertusa declined in the Alboran Sea during a period of substantial local decline in oxygenation, but L. pertusa declined near the Mauritanian coast during a period of little local change in oxygenation.
C) oxygenation in the Alboran Sea was higher before the decline in L. pertusa than after the decline, whereas oxygenation near the Mauritanian coast was relatively low both before and after the decline in L. pertusa.
D) oxygenation in the Alboran Sea tended to be substantially higher than oxygenation near the Mauritanian coast during the period studied.

The Younger Dryas was a period of extreme cooling from 11,700 to 12,900 years ago in the Northern Hemisphere. Some scientists argue that a comet fragment hitting Earth brought about the cooling. Others disagree, partly because there is no known crater from such an impact that dates to the beginning of the period. In 2015, a team led by Kurt Kjær detected a 19-mile-wide crater beneath a glacier in Greenland. The scientists who believe an impact caused the Younger Dryas claim that this discovery supports their view. However, Kjær's team hasn't yet been able to determine the age of the crater. Therefore, the team suggests that $\qquad$
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A) it can't be concluded that the impact that made the crater was connected to the beginning of the Younger Dryas.
B) it can't be determined whether a comet fragment could make a crater as large as 19 miles wide.
C) scientists have ignored the possibility that something other than a comet fragment could have made the crater.
D) the scientists who believe an impact caused the Younger Dryas have made incorrect assumptions about when the period began.
