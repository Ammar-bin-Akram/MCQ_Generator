Data collected by the Mars rover Curiosity at the Gale Crater's Murray Formation are suggestive of hydrological deposition of sediment in the distant past. To characterize the nature of the depositional environment, Frances Rivera-Hernández et al. analyzed the grain size of Murray Formation sediment, finding that although there are intervals of coarse grains, most of the sediment consists of fine grains that show signs of cracking due to episodic desiccation. Rivera-Hernández et al. concluded that the coarse grains are sandstone, which tends to be deposited by flowing water, whereas the fine grains are mudstone, which is slowly deposited by settling out of suspension in low-flow water, leading the researchers to posit that $\qquad$
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A) although the area of the Murray Formation experienced a prolonged period of dryness that prevented a lake from forming, water flowing from a distant source was present.
B) a lake existed at the Murray Formation for a prolonged period, though the lake occasionally experienced drying and there were periods in which one or more streams were present.
C) one or more streams existed at the Murray Formation for an extended period until being replaced by a lake that persisted for only a brief period before permanently drying.
D) a stream-fed lake was present at the Murray Formation for an extended period, and although the streams experienced occasional drying, the lake did not.

An analysis by Alain Elayi and colleagues of coins minted in Sidon in the fifth and fourth centuries BCE reveals a change in their composition over time: while a coin from circa 450 BCE contains about $98 \%$ silver and $1 \%$ copper, a coin from 367 BCE (the end of Ba'alšillem II's reign) contains $74.2 \%$ silver and $24.7 \%$ copper, giving it a relatively yellowish appearance that traders would have noticed. Because coins with a silver content below $80 \%$ were widely considered unsuitable for trade, Elayi et al. speculate that a crisis in confidence in the currency occurred in Sidon around 367 BCE, which was likely relieveddespite Sidon's persistent oppressive financial obligations-as a result of Ba'alšillem II's successor Abd'aštart I's decision to $\qquad$
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A) proclaim that the percentage of silver in coins suitable for trade would be raised to a threshold higher than $80 \%$.
B) keep the amount of silver in Sidonian coins consistent with that in coins minted in 367 BCE but decrease their weight.
C) begin minting heavier coins with a proportion of silver to copper similar to that in coins minted in 367 BCE.
D) fund the mining of some copper deposits that were not available to Ba'alšillem II.
