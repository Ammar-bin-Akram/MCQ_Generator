Which quotation from "Lines Written in Early Spring" most effectively illustrates the claim?
A) "Through primrose-tufts, in that sweet bower, / The periwinkle trail'd its wreathes; / And 'tis my faith that every flower / Enjoys the air it breathes."
B) "The budding twigs spread out their fan, / To catch the breezy air; / And I must think, do all I can, / That there was pleasure there."
C) "The birds around me hopp'd and play'd: / Their thoughts I cannot measure, / But the least motion which they made, / It seem'd a thrill of pleasure."
D) "I heard a thousand blended notes, / While in a grove I [sat] reclined, / In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts / Bring sad thoughts to the mind."

| Measure | Mean rating for participants <br> aware of taking a placebo | Mean rating for participants <br> in the control group |
| :-- | :--: | :--: |

To test whether a medication is effective, scientists compare outcomes for patients taking it and patients taking a placebo (a medically inactive substance). Patients normally aren't told they're receiving a placebo, but a research team conducted a study to see if there might be a medical benefit to telling them. The team used various measures to evaluate participants, with higher ratings indicating greater well-being in each measure. Compared to the mean ratings after 21 days for participants in the control group, the mean ratings for participants who were aware of taking a placebo $\qquad$
Which choice most effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement?
A) ranged from 5.0 to 92.00 , indicating that well-being varied widely from participant to participant.
B) were lower for two measures, with the rating for only one measure indicating greater well-being for these participants.
C) ranged from 3.9 to 46.00 , with no rating indicating greater well-being in any measure for these participants.
D) were higher for all three measures, indicating greater overall well-being for these participants.

As media consumption has become increasingly multiplatform and socially mediated, active news acquisition has diminished in favor of an attitude known as "news finds me" (NFM), in which people passively rely on their social networks and ambient media environments for information about current events. Homero Gil de Zúñiga and Trevor Diehl examined data on a representative group of adults in the United States to determine participants' strength of NFM attitude, political knowledge, and political interest. Although no major election took place sufficiently near the study for Gil de Zúñiga and Diehl to identify causality between NFM and voting behavior, they did posit that NFM may reduce voting probability through an indirect effect.
Which finding, if true, would most directly support the idea advanced by Gil de Zúñiga and Diehl?
A) NFM attitude tends to increase in strength as major elections approach, and people are significantly more likely to vote in major elections than in minor elections.
B) NFM attitude has a strong negative effect on political knowledge and interest, and there is known to be a strong positive correlation between political knowledge and interest and the likelihood of voting.
C) Political interest is known to have a strong positive effect on likelihood of voting but shows only a weak positive effect on political knowledge, and NFM attitude shows little correlation with either political knowledge or political interest.
D) The likelihood of voting increases as political knowledge increases, and the relationship between NFM attitude and political knowledge tends to strengthen as the size of people's social networks increases.
