Many literary theorists distinguish between fabula, a narrative's content, and syuzhet, a narrative's arrangement and presentation of events. In the film The Godfather Part II, the fabula is the story of the Corleone family, and the syuzhet is the presentation of the story as it alternates between two timelines in 1901 and 1958. But literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin maintained that fabula and syuzhet are insufficient to completely describe a narrative-he held that systematic categorizations of artistic phenomena discount the subtle way in which meaning is created by interactions between the artist, the work, and the audience.

Which choice best states the main idea of the text?
A) Literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin argued that there are important characteristics of narratives that are not fully encompassed by two concepts that other theorists have used to analyze narratives.
B) Literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin claimed that meaning is not inherent in a narrative but is created when an audience encounters a narrative so that narratives are interpreted differently by different people.
C) The storytelling methods used in The Godfather Part II may seem unusually complicated, but they can be easily understood when two concepts from literary theory are utilized.
D) Narratives that are told out of chronological order are more difficult for audiences to understand than are narratives presented chronologically.

A student is researching the trends in the topics submitted to a national science fair for high school students. The graph shows the number of submissions by topic that were made each year. Based on the data in the graph, the student claims that there were more medicine and health research topics submitted in 2019 than in any other year.

Which choice most effectively uses data from the graph to support the underlined claim?
A) In 2016, the number of cellular and molecular biology topic submissions was the same as the number of animal science topic submissions.
B) In 2019, there were more physics and space science topic submissions than there were medicine and health topic submissions.
C) The lowest number of animal science topic submissions in a year was approximately 95 in 2016.
D) The highest number of medicine and health topic submissions during the period shown is approximately 285 in 2019.

Fish whose DNA has been modified to include genetic material from other species are known as transgenic. Some transgenic fish have genes from jellyfish that result in fluorescence (that is, they glow in the dark). Although these fish were initially engineered for research purposes in the 1990s, they were sold as pets in the 2000s and can now be found in the wild in creeks in Brazil. A student in a biology seminar who is writing a paper on these fish asserts that their escape from Brazilian fish farms into the wild may have significant negative long-term ecological effects.

Which quotation from a researcher would best support the student's assertion?
A) "In one site in the wild where transgenic fish were observed, females outnumbered males, while in another the numbers of females and males were equivalent."
B) "Though some presence of transgenic fish in the wild has been recorded, there are insufficient studies of the impact of those fish on the ecosystems into which they are introduced."
C) "The ecosystems into which transgenic fish are known to have been introduced may represent a subset of the ecosystems into which the fish have actually been introduced."
D) "Through interbreeding, transgenic fish might introduce the trait of fluorescence into wild fish populations, making those populations more vulnerable to predators."

Inés Ibáñez and colleagues studied a forest site in which some sugar maple trees receive periodic fertilization with nitrogen to mimic the broader trend of increasing anthropogenic nitrogen deposition in soil. Ibáñez and colleagues modeled the radial growth of the trees with and without nitrogen fertilization under three different climate scenarios (the current climate, moderate change, and extreme change). Although they found that climate change would negatively affect growth, they concluded that anthropogenic nitrogen deposition could more than offset that effect provided that change is moderate rather than extreme.

Which choice best describes data from the graph that support Ibáñez and colleagues' conclusion?
A) Growth with nitrogen under the current climate exceeded growth with nitrogen under moderate change, but the latter exceeded growth without nitrogen under extreme change.
B) Growth without nitrogen under the current climate exceeded growth without nitrogen under moderate change, but the latter exceeded growth with nitrogen under extreme change.
C) Growth with nitrogen under moderate change exceeded growth without nitrogen under moderate change, but the latter exceeded growth without nitrogen under extreme change.
D) Growth with nitrogen under moderate change exceeded growth without nitrogen under the current climate, but the latter exceeded growth with nitrogen under extreme change.

"Poetry" is a 1919 poem by Marianne Moore. The poem highlights an ambivalence toward poetry as the speaker acknowledges its merits while also expressing a sense of displeasure, writing $\qquad$
Which quotation from "Poetry" most effectively illustrates the claim?
A) "nor is it valid / to discriminate against 'business documents and / school-books'; all these phenomena are important."
B) "One must make a distinction / however: when dragged into prominence by half poets, the result is not / poetry"
C) "when [poems] become so derivative as to become unintelligible, the / same thing may be said for all of us-that we / do not admire what / we cannot understand."
D) "Reading [poetry], however, with a perfect contempt for it, one discovers that there is in / it after all, a place for the genuine."

Simulated Change in Annual Aquifer Input and Irrigation Output if Precipitation Concentration Increases as Climate Models Predict

| Baseline concentration of <br> annual precipitation | \% change in water <br> entering aquifers | \% change in surface <br> water used for <br> irrigation | \% change in <br> groundwater used <br> for irrigation |
| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Precipitation is currently <br> somewhat concentrated | 4.9 | 0.4 | 0.9 |
| Precipitation is currently <br> evenly distributed | 11.0 | 9.0 | 7.9 |

Some climate models for the western United States predict that while total annual precipitation may remain unchanged from the present level, precipitation will become concentrated into fewer but more intense rain and snow events. University of Texas climate scientist Geeta Persad and her colleagues simulated how the amount of water entering aquifers and the amount being used for irrigation purposes would change if this were to occur. Persad and her colleagues concluded that concentration of precipitation into fewer events would result in a higher number of dry days, triggering more irrigation, but that this change in irrigation output is highly sensitive to the baseline concentration of precipitation that currently exists in an area.

Which choice best describes data from the table that support Persad and her colleagues' conclusion?
A) If baseline precipitation is somewhat concentrated, the amount of water being used for irrigation will increase $0.4 \%$ for surface water and $0.9 \%$ for groundwater, whereas the amount of water entering aquifers will increase $11.0 \%$ if baseline precipitation is evenly distributed.
B) If baseline precipitation is somewhat concentrated, water use for irrigation will increase only slightly, whereas it will increase $9.0 \%$ for surface water and $7.9 \%$ for groundwater if baseline precipitation is evenly distributed.
C) If baseline precipitation is somewhat concentrated, the amount of water entering aquifers will increase $4.9 \%$, while the amount being used for irrigation will increase $0.4 \%$ for surface water and $0.9 \%$ for groundwater.
D) If baseline precipitation is somewhat concentrated, water use for irrigation will decline by a small amount, whereas it will increase $11.0 \%$ for surface water and $9.0 \%$ for groundwater if baseline precipitation is evenly distributed.

In dialects of English spoken in Scotland, the " r " sound is strongly emphasized when it appears at the end of syllables (as in "car") or before other consonant sounds (as in "bird"). English dialects of the Upland South, a region stretching from Oklahoma to western Virginia, place similar emphasis on "r" at the ends of syllables and before other consonant sounds. Historical records show that the Upland South was colonized largely by people whose ancestors came from Scotland. Thus, linguists have concluded that $\qquad$
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A) the English dialects spoken in the Upland South acquired their emphasis on the "r" sound from dialects spoken in Scotland.
B) emphasis on the "r" sound will eventually spread from English dialects spoken in the Upland South to dialects spoken elsewhere.
C) the English dialects spoken in Scotland were influenced by dialects spoken in the Upland South.
D) people from Scotland abandoned their emphasis on the "r" sound after relocating to the Upland South.
