Several studies have found negligible electoral consequences for governments that impose fiscal austerity measures, yet some European governments recently suffered electorally due to their austerity programs. Evelyne Huebscher and colleagues attribute this incongruity to governments' tendency-not followed in the recent European cases-to implement austerity programs strategically to avoid electoral costs (e.g., setting spending cuts to take effect only after the next election), which has obscured the inherent political risks of austerity measures in the election data scholars have examined.

Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?
A) It explains a discrepancy between what has been observed in study settings and what has been observed in real-world settings that the text goes on to assert is attributable to the studies not using real-world data.
B) It identifies a conflict between research findings and recent events that the text goes on to suggest is a consequence of a complicating factor in the data used to generate those findings.
C) It presents a long-standing divergence in research findings that the text goes on to say is due to different groups of researchers using data that derive from different electoral circumstances.
D) It describes a recent exception to a general pattern in research findings that the text goes on to explain is a result of researchers underestimating the significance of inconsistencies in the data they've analyzed.

## Text 1

Graphic novels are increasingly popular in bookstores and libraries, but they shouldn't be classified as literature. By definition, literature tells a story or conveys meaning through language only; graphic novels tell stories through illustrations and use language only sparingly, in captions and dialogue. Graphic novels are experienced as series of images and not as language, making them more similar to film than to literature.

## Text 2

Graphic novels present their stories through both language and images. Without captions and dialogue, readers would be unable to understand what is depicted in the illustrations: the story results from the interaction of text and image. Moreover, Alison Bechdel's Fun Home and many other graphic novels feature text that is as beautifully written as the prose found in many standard novels. Therefore, graphic novels qualify as literary texts.
Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the overall argument presented in Text 1?
A) By asserting that language plays a more important role in graphic novels than the author of Text 1 recognizes
B) By acknowledging that the author of Text 1 has identified a flaw that is common to all graphic novels
C) By suggesting that the story lines of certain graphic novels are more difficult to understand than the author of Text 1 claims
D) By agreeing with the author of Text 1 that most graphic novels aren't as well crafted as most literary works are

The following text is adapted from Ann Petry's 1946 novel The Street. Lutie lives in an apartment in Harlem, New York.

The glow from the sunset was making the street radiant. The street is nice in this light, [Lutie] thought. It was swarming with children who were playing ball and darting back and forth across the sidewalk in complicated games of tag. Girls were skipping double dutch rope, going tirelessly through the exact center of a pair of ropes, jumping first on one foot and then the other.

Which choice best describes what is happening in the text?
A) Lutie is observing the appearance of the street at a particular time of day and the events occurring on it.
B) Lutie is annoyed by the noise of children playing games on her street.
C) Lutie is puzzled by the rules of certain children's games.
D) Lutie is spending time alone in her apartment because she doesn't want to interact with her neighbors.

Since its completion in 2014, Bosco Verticale (Vertical Forest)—a pair of residential towers in Milan, Italy, covered by vegetation-has become a striking symbol of environmental sustainability in architecture. Stefano Boeri intended his design, which features balconies that are home to hundreds of trees, to serve as a model for promoting urban biodiversity. However, the concept has faced skepticism: critics note that although the trees used in Bosco Verticale were specifically cultivated for the project, it's too early to tell if they can thrive in this unusual setting.

According to the text, why are some critics skeptical of the concept behind Bosco Verticale?
A) Some essential aspects of Bosco Verticale's design are difficult to adapt to locations other than Milan.
B) The plant life on Bosco Verticale ended up being less varied than Boeri had envisioned it would be.
C) The construction of Bosco Verticale was no less environmentally damaging than the construction of more conventional buildings is.
D) It is unclear whether Bosco Verticale can support the plant life included in its design.
