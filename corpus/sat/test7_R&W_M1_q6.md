The following text is from Joan Didion's memoir The Year of Magical Thinking. In the text, the author discusses her home life.
[I]n California we heated our houses by building fires. We built fires even on summer evenings, because the fog came in. Fires said we were home, we had drawn the circle, we were safe through the night.
(C2005 by Joan Didion
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?
A) It illustrates that a fire provides comfort beyond physical warmth.
B) It summarizes the information that came before it in the text.
C) It explains that the house remains cold even in summer.
D) It suggests that the author feels comfortable in her home with or without a fire.

The majority of plastics today wind up in landfills or are, at best, recycled into materials that have a very limited range of applications. To address this problem, chemist Guoliang Liu and colleagues designed a reactor that melts polyethylene and polypropylene-two widely used plastics-into a wax. The wax can then be transformed into a surfactant (a chemical compound usable as a detergent). With this promising new method, plastic waste could be turned into a range of useful cleaning products.
Which choice best states the function of the underlined portion of the text?
A) It clarifies the meaning of a scientific term.
B) It describes an environmental concern.
C) It explains the significance of a scientific discovery.
D) It identifies a result that confused the team.

The following text is from H.D.'s 1916 poem "Mid-Day." In the poem, the speaker is on a path in an outdoor setting.

A slight wind shakes the seed-pods-
my thoughts are spent
as the black seeds.
My thoughts tear me,
I dread their fever.
I am scattered in its whirl.
I am scattered like
the hot shrivelled seeds.
Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?
A) It illustrates a change in the natural environment that the speaker implies is responsible for the growing misgivings described in the text.
B) It establishes an example of consistency in the natural landscape that the speaker then contrasts with the unpredictability of human emotions.
C) It presents an observation of an occurrence in the natural world that the speaker then expands on to convey a sense of a turbulent interior state.
D) It evokes the ordinariness of an event in nature to suggest that the critical self-evaluation the speaker engages in is a common pursuit.

In 2023 literary scholar Jeremy Douglass cautioned technology investors and enthusiasts who predict conventional books' ultimate displacement by newer forms of media. Douglass observed that the concept of an "interactive" text is much older than technologists assume, extending back to the first time readers scratched notes into a text's margins. In addition, newer media, such as video games, haven't replaced older forms of entertainment, such as comic books, but rather exist alongside them. Douglass believes that rather than supplanting books, technology is simply making new forms of expression possible.

Which choice best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole?
A) It challenges the stance of the investors and enthusiasts who are mentioned earlier in the text.
B) It explains the basis for the claim made by the technologists mentioned in the text.
C) It suggests that academics are better suited than investors to see the potential uses of contemporary interactive texts.
D) It provides a historical anecdote about the technological challenges involved in reading the earliest interactive texts.

In 2018, scientists discovered an immense aggregation of Muusoctopus robustus (pearl octopuses) along a hydrothermal vent 3,200 meters beneath the ocean's surface. Water temperatures at this site-named the Octopus Garden-climb as high as $11^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, much warmer than the ambient $1.6^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ typical at this depth. Based on observations made over three years, scientists concluded that temperatures at the site likely confer reproductive benefits and that the site is used exclusively for reproduction-6,000 M. robustus adults, hatchlings, and eggs were observed at the garden, but no juveniles were present.

Which statement about M. robustus and the Octopus Garden is best supported by the text?
A) M. robustus leave the Octopus Garden upon reaching an intermediary stage of development.
B) The M. robustus population at the Octopus Garden remains stable despite variations in water temperature.
C) M. robustus nests in the Octopus Garden contain on average fewer but larger eggs than nests at similar ocean depths.
D) The Octopus Garden provides an ideal feeding ground for M. robustus hatchlings.

The following text is from Thomas Mann's 1924 novel The Magic Mountain, translated by John E. Woods in 1995.

The story of Hans Castorp that we intend to tell here-not for his sake (for the reader will come to know him as a perfectly ordinary, if engaging young man), but for the sake of the story itself, which seems to us to be very much worth telling (although in Hans Castorp's favor it should be noted that it is his story, and that not every story happens to everybody)-is a story that took place long ago, and is, so to speak, covered with the patina of history and must necessarily be told with verbs whose tense is that of the deepest past. (c) 1995 by Alfred A. Knopf, Inc.

What does the text most strongly suggest about the story of Hans Castorp?
A) Though it is true that stories of even the most uninteresting people are themselves interesting because all people are unique, the reason this story is interesting is nonetheless difficult to understand because of the passage of time.
B) Even though it is a story of a person of no particular importance, its age and the manner in which it therefore must be told are both indicators that the story itself is important.
C) Like all stories about the lives of inconsequential people, this story must necessarily be related in a particular way if the reason the story is consequential is to be made evident to the audience.
D) It is a remarkable story that happened to an unremarkable person, though one could plausibly argue that because the story is valuable, some of its value accrues to the person at its center.

A student in a political science course is writing a paper on Aristotle's The Politics, in which Aristotle offers his opinion on political instability and gives advice on how constitutions can be preserved. Aristotle observes that different forms of government can fall in different ways-for example, oligarchies might grant power to military leaders during wartime who refuse to relinquish that power during peacetime-but some methods of preserving order apply across all forms of government. The student claims that in particular Aristotle asserts that in a healthy state obedience to law must be as close to absolute as possible and that even minor infractions should not be ignored.

Which quotation from a philosopher's analysis of The Politics would best support the student's claim?
A) "When constructing his argument regarding the characteristics of a well-functioning government, Aristotle asserts that 'Transgression creeps in unperceived and at last ruins the state,' illustrating this idea with a comparison to frequent small expenditures slowly and almost imperceptibly chipping away at a fortune until it is ultimately depleted."
B) "When Aristotle writes on the necessity of avoiding corruption in government, he proposes that 'every state should be so administered and so regulated by law that its magistrates cannot possibly make money.' In particular, he thinks oligarchies are particularly susceptible to corruption through bribery."
C) "When Aristotle considers the health of constitutions, he states that 'Constitutions are preserved when their destroyers are at a distance, and sometimes also because they are near, for the fear of them makes the government keep in hand the constitution.' He holds that rulers who wish to see constitutions preserved must continually remind the populace of the dangers that would result from a constitutional collapse."
D) "When contrasting different forms of government, Aristotle holds that 'oligarchies may last, not from any inherent stability in such forms of government, but because the rulers are on good terms both with the unenfranchised and with the governing classes.' That is, oligarchic leaders who wish to hold on to power will introduce members of disenfranchised classes into government in a participatory role."

Almost all works of fiction contain references to the progression of time, including the time of day when events in a story take place. In a 2020 study, Allen Kim, Charuta Pethe, and Steven Skiena claim that an observable pattern in such references reflects a shift in human behavior prompted by the spread of electric lighting in the late nineteenth century. The researchers drew this conclusion from an analysis of more than 50,000 novels spanning many centuries and cultures, using software to recognize and tally both specific time references-that is, clock phrases, such as 7 a.m. or 2:30 p.m.-and implied ones, such as mentions of meals typically associated with a particular time of day.
Which finding from the study, if true, would most directly support the researchers' conclusion?
A) Novels published after the year 1800 include the clock phrase 10 a.m. less often than novels published before the year 1800 do.
B) Novels published after 1880 contain significantly more references to activities occurring after 10 p.m. than do novels from earlier periods.
C) Among novels published in the nineteenth century, implied time references become steadily more common than clock phrases as publication dates approach 1900.
D) The time references of noon ( 12 p.m.) and midnight ( 12 a.m.) are used with roughly the same frequency in the novels.

Percentage of ULE Attributed to Population Growth and GDP per Capita Growth in Two World Regions
[Image removed]

Region, by time period
urban population growth
GDP per capita growth

In a study of urban physical expansion, Richa Mahtta et al. conducted a meta-analysis of more than 300 cities worldwide to determine whether urban land expansion (ULE) was more strongly influenced by urban population growth or by growth in gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, a measure of economic activity. Because efficient national government is necessary to provide urban services and infrastructure that attract economic investment, Mahtta et al. propose that absent other factors, the importance of GDP per capita growth to ULE would likely increase relative to the importance of population growth as governments become more efficient. If true, this suggests the possibility that $\qquad$

Which choice most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the statement?
A) national governments of countries in Region 1 experienced declines in efficiency in the period from 2000 to 2014, relative to the period from 1970 to 2000.
B) countries in Region 1 experienced a slower rate of economic growth in the period from 2000 to 2014 than countries in Region 2 did, despite increasing national government efficiency in Region 1.
C) national governments of most countries in Region 2 became more efficient in the period from 2000 to 2014 than they had been in the period from 1970 to 2000, but those of several countries in this region did not.
D) national governments of countries in Region 1 and in Region 2 generally became more efficient in the period from 2000 to 2014 than they had been in the period from 1970 to 2000, but at different rates.

A student is researching the Chinese government's 1992 shift to a market economy that emphasizes trade liberalization. One means of trade liberalization involves expanding from ordinary imports into an emphasis on processing imports, which have two types: processing with assembly (in which a firm obtains raw materials from a foreign trading partner without payment and sells the final goods to that partner, charging for assembly) and processing with inputs (in which a firm expends capital to buy raw materials from a trading partner, processes them into final goods, and sells those goods to whichever trading partner it chooses). The student asserts that while initial efforts at trade liberalization were shaped by Chinese firms' limited capital, this situation resolved during the 2000s.

Which choice best describes data from the graph that support the student's assertion?
A) Processing imports with inputs were greater than both ordinary imports and processing imports with assembly in 2006.
B) From 2000 to 2006, processing imports with inputs rose much more sharply than processing imports with assembly did.
C) From 2000 to 2006, neither processing imports with inputs nor processing imports with assembly were greater than ordinary imports.
D) Processing imports with assembly were greater in 2006 than processing imports with inputs in 2000.

Narwhals are shy whales that live in the remote Arctic Ocean. Some of them have a long tusk, like a unicorn horn, with sensitive nerves. Narwhals are known for this tusk, but many actually don't have one and its purpose is unknown. One group of scientists came up with a possible purpose in 2014. The scientists suggested that the tusk may help narwhals determine when water around them is likely to start freezing and become dangerous for them. Marine biologist Kristin Laidre disagrees with that idea, though. She reasons that if the narwhal's tusk serves such an important purpose, then it's most likely that $\qquad$
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A) some narwhals would seek a new habitat.
B) fewer marine animals would also have tusks.
C) more narwhals would have a tusk.
D) narwhals would become less shy over time.

To address the susceptibility of materials used in components of high-performance machinery, such as aircraft engines, to creep (deformation that is induced by persistent mechanical stress and that often occurs at elevated temperatures), materials researchers have developed silicon carbide ( SiC ) fibers for producing aerospace composites. Testing the thermomechanical properties of several commercially available SiC fibers, Ramakrishna T. Bhatt et al. found that in comparison with two polymer-derived SiC fibers, a nitrogen-treated SiC fiber exhibited a lower minimum creep rate, a measure of the rate at which a stress-exposed material deforms at a constant temperature and uniaxial load. The finding suggests that $\qquad$
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A) unlike the two polymer-derived SiC fibers, the nitrogen-treated SiC fiber can substantially inhibit creep, provided that temperatures and loads are consistent.
B) the two polymer-derived SiC fibers likely hold similar potential for reducing the creep resistance of materials exposed to stress and elevated temperatures, thus prolonging the life span of aerospace machinery.
C) composites based on the two polymer-derived SiC fibers have chemical properties that may improve the mechanical and thermal stability of aerospace equipment to a greater extent than do composites based on the nitrogen-treated SiC fiber.
D) aerospace composites containing the nitrogen-treated SiC fiber may have the ability to withstand mechanical stress for a longer period of time than can aerospace composites containing either of the two polymer-derived SiC fibers.
