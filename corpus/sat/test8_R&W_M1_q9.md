## Text 1

Ecologists have long wondered how thousands of microscopic phytoplankton species can live together near ocean surfaces competing for the same resources. According to conventional wisdom, one species should emerge after outcompeting the rest. So why do so many species remain? Ecologists' many efforts to explain this phenomenon still haven't uncovered a satisfactory explanation.

## Text 2

Ecologist Michael Behrenfeld and colleagues have connected phytoplankton's diversity to their microscopic size. Because these organisms are so tiny, they are spaced relatively far apart from each other in ocean water and, moreover, experience that water as a relatively dense substance. This in turn makes it hard for them to move around and interact with one another. Therefore, says Behrenfeld's team, direct competition among phytoplankton probably happens much less than previously thought.
Based on the texts, how would Behrenfeld and colleagues (Text 2) most likely respond to the "conventional wisdom" discussed in Text 1?
A) By arguing that it is based on a misconception about phytoplankton species competing with one another
B) By asserting that it fails to recognize that routine replenishment of ocean nutrients prevents competition between phytoplankton species
C) By suggesting that their own findings help clarify how phytoplankton species are able to compete with larger organisms
D) By recommending that more ecologists focus their research on how competition among phytoplankton species is increased with water density

The following text is adapted from Sylvia Acevedo's 2018 memoir Path to the Stars: My Journey from Girl Scout to Rocket Scientist. The narrator is traveling by car with her family to Mexico City. Mario and Laura are her brother and sister.

Mario and I played games to see how many different license plates we could spot, and Laura liked to look for children in the back seats of the cars we passed. We were used to the forty-fiveminute drive to El Paso and familiar with the six-hour ride to Chihuahua, but I wondered what the long journey to Mexico City would be like.

According to the text, what did the narrator and Mario do while riding in the car?
A) They read books.
B) They sang songs.
C) They went to sleep.
D) They played games.

In the 1700s and 1800s, European composers experimented with volume in their musical works. They did so by increasing the number of musicians playing in the orchestra. For example, in some of his operas, German composer Richard Wagner added more horns, trombones, and tubas to the orchestra. With more instruments playing at the same time, the orchestra could play extremely loudly at key moments in his operas.

According to the text, how did Richard Wagner achieve moments of extremely high volume in his operas?
A) By moving the performances of his operas from outdoor stages to indoor ones
B) By increasing the number of musicians playing horns, trombones, and tubas in the orchestra
C) By building a concert hall whose shape would cause sounds to echo
D) By insisting that the singers undergo special training to sing for extended periods of time

Poetry in Classical Nahuatl, the language of the Aztec Empire, relies on difrasismo, or a parallel noun construction that conventionally operates as a single metaphor. For example, the common difrasismo in cuauhtli in ocelotl (literally, "the eagle, the jaguar") signifies "warrior." The device's function is both formal—providing structure to lines of verse-and ritual: semantic relations among the two nouns and the concept they signify can be tenuous, as in the previous example, such that difrasismos are often only intelligible according to the conceptual associations observed in Aztec ceremonial culture.

Which statement about the difrasismo in cuauhtli in ocelotl is most strongly supported by the text?
A) Its metaphorical significance derives from the semantic equivalence of the two nouns constituting the difrasismo.
B) Its unintelligibility may cause its formal function within a line of verse to go unnoticed by present-day readers.
C) Its apparent obscurity can be resolved when considered in the proper cultural context.
D) Its frequency in Classical Nahuatl poetry confirms its intelligibility to the Aztec audience.
