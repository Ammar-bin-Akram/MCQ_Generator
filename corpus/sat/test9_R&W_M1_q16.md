In the twentieth century, ethnographers made a concerted effort to collect Mexican American folklore, but they did not always agree about that folklore's origins. Scholars such as Aurelio Espinosa claimed that Mexican American folklore derived largely from the folklore of Spain, which ruled Mexico and what is now the southwestern United States from the sixteenth to early nineteenth centuries. Scholars such as Américo Paredes, by contrast, argued that while some Spanish influence is undeniable, Mexican American folklore is mainly the product of the ongoing interactions of various cultures in Mexico and the United States.

Which finding, if true, would most directly support Paredes's argument?
A) The folklore that the ethnographers collected included several songs written in the form of a décima, a type of poem originating in late sixteenth-century Spain.
B) Much of the folklore that the ethnographers collected had similar elements from region to region.
C) Most of the folklore that the ethnographers collected was previously unknown to scholars.
D) Most of the folklore that the ethnographers collected consisted of corridos-ballads about history and social life-of a clearly recent origin.

Among social animals that care for their young, such as chickens, macaque monkeys, and humans, newborns appear to show an innate attraction to faces and face-like stimuli. Elisabetta Versace and her colleagues used an image of three black dots arranged in the shape of eyes and a nose or mouth to test whether this trait also occurs in Testudo tortoises, which live alone and do not engage in parental care. They found that tortoise hatchlings showed a significant preference for the image, suggesting that $\qquad$
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A) face-like stimuli are likely perceived as harmless by newborns of social species that practice parental care but as threatening by newborns of solitary species without parental care.
B) researchers should not assume that an innate attraction to face-like stimuli is necessarily an adaptation related to social interaction or parental care.
C) researchers can assume that the attraction to face-like stimuli that is seen in social species that practice parental care is learned rather than innate.
D) newly hatched Testudo tortoises show a stronger preference for face-like stimuli than adult Testudo tortoises do.

Aptamers-synthetic DNA or RNA molecules that bind to target molecules-can be used to test for foodborne bacterial pathogens, though their specificity (the probability of returning a negative result in the absence of the focal pathogen) in real-world foods has been unclear. Sandeep Somvanshi et al. fabricated test paper incorporating aptamers targeting strain O157:H7 of the bacteria Escherichia coli; the paper shifts from pink to purple as the aptamers bind to target molecules. Somvanshi et al. tested the paper in store-bought pear juice they treated with E. coli O157:H7, other strains of E. coli, or other bacteria species. Following exposure, the paper from the O157:H7 test was purple while papers from the other tests were pink, suggesting that $\qquad$
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A) aptamer-based tests in real-world foods are more likely to show a high degree of specificity if the focal pathogen is E. coli O157:H7 than if the focal pathogen is another strain of E. coli or another species.
B) uncertainty about the specificity of aptamer-based tests for pathogens in real-world foods may be due to the similarity between E. coli O157:H7 and other E. coli strains.
C) the specificity of the tests in a real-world food was unaffected by the aptamers' tendency to bind to different strains of E. coli.
D) the aptamers successfully bound to E. coli O157:H7 and the tests displayed a high degree of specificity in a real-world food.

British scientists James Watson and Francis Crick won the Nobel Prize in part for their 1953 paper announcing the double helix structure of DNA, but it is misleading to say that Watson and Crick discovered the double helix. $\qquad$ findings were based on a famous X-ray image of DNA fibers, "Photo 51," developed by X-ray crystallographer Rosalind Franklin and her graduate student Raymond Gosling.
