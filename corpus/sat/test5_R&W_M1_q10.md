Changes to vegetation cover and other human activities influence carbon and nitrogen levels in soil, though how deep these effects extend is unclear. Hypothesizing that differences in land use lead to differences in carbon and nitrogen levels that are not restricted to the topsoil layer ( $0-30 \mathrm{~cm}$ deep), Chukwuebuka Okolo and colleagues sampled soils across multiple land-use types (e.g., grazing land, cropland, forest) within each of several Ethiopian locations. They found, though, that across land-use types, carbon and nitrogen decreased to comparably low levels beyond depths of 30 cm .

Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?
A) It describes a phenomenon that scientists do not fully understand, explains a research team's hypothesis about that phenomenon, and then describes a finding that led the team to refine the hypothesis.
B) It introduces an unresolved scientific question, presents a research team's hypothesis pertaining to that question, and then describes an observation made by the team that conflicts with that hypothesis.
C) It discusses a process that scientists are somewhat unclear about, introduces competing hypotheses about that process, and then explains how a research team concluded that one of those hypotheses is likely correct.
D) It explains a hypothesis that has been the subject of scientific debate, discusses how a research team tested that hypothesis, and then presents data the team collected that validate the hypothesis.

Recently, scientists looked at data collected by NASA's InSight lander to learn more about seismic activity on Mars, known as marsquakes. The data show that the marsquakes all started from the same location on the planet. This discovery was surprising to scientists, as they expected that the marsquakes would originate from all over the planet because of the cooling of the planet's surface. Now, scientists believe that there could be areas of active magma flows deep beneath the planet's surface that trigger the marsquakes.

According to the text, what was surprising to scientists studying the seismic activity data from NASA's InSight lander?
A) The surface temperature of Mars has been rising.
B) There were different types of seismic waves causing marsquakes.
C) NASA's InSight lander collected less data than scientists had expected.
D) All the marsquakes started from the same location on the planet.
