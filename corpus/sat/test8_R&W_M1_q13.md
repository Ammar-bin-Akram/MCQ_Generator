Eighteenth-century economist Adam Smith is famed for his metaphor of the invisible hand, which he putatively used to illustrate a robust model of how individuals produce aggregate benefits by pursuing their own economic interests. Note "putatively": as Gavin Kennedy has shown, Smith deploys this metaphor only once in his economic writings-to make a narrow point about the then-dominant economic theory of mercantilism-and it was largely ignored until some twentieth-century economists eager to secure an intellectual pedigree for their views elevated it to a fully-fledged paradigm.

Which choice best states the main idea of the text?
A) Although Smith is famed for his metaphor of the invisible hand, the metaphor was largely ignored until economists in the twentieth century came to realize that the metaphor was a robust model that anticipated their own views.
B) Some twentieth-century economists gave Smith's metaphor of the invisible hand a significance it does not have in Smith's work, but it is nevertheless a useful model of how individuals produce aggregate benefits by pursuing their own economic interests.
C) Smith's metaphor of the invisible hand has been interpreted as a model of how individuals acting in their own interest produce aggregate benefits, but it was intended as a subtle critique of the economic theory of mercantilism.
D) The reputation of Smith's metaphor of the invisible hand is not due to the importance of the metaphor in Smith's work but rather to the promotion of the metaphor by some later economists for their own ends.

Approximate Rates of Speech and Information Conveyed for Five Languages

| Language | Rate of speech <br> (syllables <br> per second) | Rate of information <br> conveyed (bits <br> per second) |
| :-- | :--: | :--: |
| Serbian | 7.2 | 39.1 |
| Spanish | 7.7 | 42.0 |
| Vietnamese | 5.3 | 42.5 |
| Thai | 4.7 | 33.8 |
| Hungarian | 5.9 | 34.6 |

A group of researchers working in Europe, Asia, and Oceania conducted a study to determine how quickly different Eurasian languages are typically spoken (in syllables per second) and how much information they can effectively convey (in bits per second). They found that, although languages vary widely in the speed at which they are spoken, the amount of information languages can effectively convey tends to vary much less. Thus, they claim that two languages with very different spoken rates can nonetheless convey the same amount of information in a given amount of time.

Which choice best describes data from the table that support the researchers' claim?
A) Among the five languages in the table, Thai and Hungarian have the lowest rates of speech and the lowest rates of information conveyed.
B) Vietnamese conveys information at approximately the same rate as Spanish despite being spoken at a slower rate.
C) Among the five languages in the table, the language that is spoken the fastest is also the language that conveys information the fastest.
D) Serbian and Spanish are spoken at approximately the same rate, but Serbian conveys information faster than Spanish does.

Estimates of Tyrannosaurid Bite Force

| Study | Year | Estimation method | Approximate bite force <br> (newtons) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :--: |
| Cost et al. | 2019 | muscular and skeletal modeling | $35,000-63,000$ |
| Gignac and Erickson | 2017 | tooth-bone interaction analysis | $8,000-34,000$ |
| Meers | 2002 | body-mass scaling | $183,000-235,000$ |
| Bates and Falkingham | 2012 | muscular and skeletal modeling | $35,000-57,000$ |

The largest tyrannosaurids-the family of carnivorous dinosaurs that includes Tarbosaurus, Albertosaurus, and, most famously, Tyrannosaurus rex-are thought to have had the strongest bites of any land animals in Earth's history. Determining the bite force of extinct animals can be difficult, however, and paleontologists Paul Barrett and Emily Rayfield have suggested that an estimate of dinosaur bite force may be significantly influenced by the methodology used in generating that estimate.

Which choice best describes data from the table that support Barrett and Rayfield's suggestion?
A) The study by Meers used body-mass scaling and produced the lowest estimated maximum bite force, while the study by Cost et al. used muscular and skeletal modeling and produced the highest estimated maximum.
B) In their study, Gignac and Erickson used tooth-bone interaction analysis to produce an estimated bite force range with a minimum of 8,000 newtons and a maximum of 34,000 newtons.
C) The bite force estimates produced by Bates and Falkingham and by Cost et al. were similar to each other, while the estimates produced by Meers and by Gignac and Erickson each differed substantially from any other estimate.
D) The estimated maximum bite force produced by Cost et al. exceeded the estimated maximum produced by Bates and Falkingham, even though both groups of researchers used the same method to generate their estimates.

Psychologists Dacher Keltner and Jonathan Haidt have argued that experiencing awe-a sensation of reverence and wonder typically brought on by perceiving something grand or powerful-can enable us to feel more connected to others and thereby inspire us to act more altruistically. Keltner, along with Paul K. Piff, Pia Dietze, and colleagues, claims to have found evidence for this effect in a recent study where participants were asked to either gaze up at exceptionally tall trees in a nearby grove (reported to be a universally awe-inspiring experience) or stare at the exterior of a nearby, nondescript building. After one minute, an experimenter deliberately spilled a box of pens nearby.
Which finding from the researchers' study, if true, would most strongly support their claim?
A) Participants who had been looking at the trees helped the experimenter pick up significantly more pens than did participants who had been looking at the building.
B) Participants who helped the experimenter pick up the pens used a greater number of positive words to describe the trees and the building in a postexperiment survey than did participants who did not help the experimenter.
C) Participants who did not help the experimenter pick up the pens were significantly more likely to report having experienced a feeling of awe, regardless of whether they looked at the building or the trees.
D) Participants who had been looking at the building were significantly more likely to notice that the experimenter had dropped the pens than were participants who had been looking at the trees.
