Maximum Height of Maple Trees
When Fully Grown

| Tree type | Maximum <br> height (feet) | Native to <br> North America |
| :-- | :--: | :--: |
| Sugar maple | 75 | yes |
| Silver maple | 70 | yes |
| Red maple | 60 | yes |
| Japanese maple | 25 | no |
| Norway maple | 50 | no |

For a school project, a forestry student needs to recommend a maple tree that is native to North America and won't grow more than 60 feet in height. Based on the characteristics of five common maple trees, she has decided to select a $\qquad$

A) silver maple.
B) sugar maple.
C) red maple.
D) Norway maple.

Many plants lose their leaf color when exposed to kanamycin, an antibiotic produced by some soil microorganisms. Spelman College biologist Mentewab Ayalew and her colleagues hypothesized that plants' response to kanamycin exposure involves altering their uptake of metals, such as iron and zinc. The researchers grew two groups of seedlings of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, half of which were exposed to kanamycin and half of which were a control group without exposure to kanamycin, and measured the plants' metal content five days after germination.

Which choice best describes data in the graph that support Ayalew and her colleagues' hypothesis?
A) The control plants contained higher levels of zinc than iron, but plants exposed to kanamycin contained higher levels of iron than zinc.
B) Both groups of plants contained more than 200 parts per million of both iron and zinc.
C) Zinc levels were around 300 parts per million in the control plants but nearly 400 parts per million in the plants exposed to kanamycin.
D) The plants exposed to kanamycin showed lower levels of iron and zinc than the control plants did.

Average Number and Duration of Torpor Bouts and Arousal Episodes for Alaska Marmots and Arctic Ground Squirrels, 2008-2011

| Feature | Alaska marmots | Arctic ground <br> squirrels |
| :-- | :--: | :--: |
| torpor bouts | 12 | 10.5 |
| duration per bout | 13.81 days | 16.77 days |
| arousal episodes | 11 | 9.5 |
| duration per episode | 21.2 hours | 14.2 hours |

When hibernating, Alaska marmots and Arctic ground squirrels enter a state called torpor, which minimizes the energy their bodies need to function. Often a hibernating animal will temporarily come out of torpor (called an arousal episode) and its metabolic rate will rise, burning more of the precious energy the animal needs to survive the winter. Alaska marmots hibernate in groups and therefore burn less energy keeping warm during these episodes than they would if they were alone. A researcher hypothesized that because Arctic ground squirrels hibernate alone, they would likely exhibit longer bouts of torpor and shorter arousal episodes than Alaska marmots.

Which choice best describes data from the table that support the researcher's hypothesis?
A) The Alaska marmots' arousal episodes lasted for days, while the Arctic ground squirrels' arousal episodes lasted less than a day.
B) The Alaska marmots and the Arctic ground squirrels both maintained torpor for several consecutive days per bout, on average.
C) The Alaska marmots had shorter torpor bouts and longer arousal episodes than the Arctic ground squirrels did.
D) The Alaska marmots had more torpor bouts than arousal episodes, but their arousal episodes were much shorter than their torpor bouts.

Honeybee hives consist mainly of hexagonal (six-sided) units called cells, in which queens lay eggs. Hexagonal cells for eggs that develop into nonreproductive workers are smaller than those for eggs that develop into reproductive drones, though the size difference varies by species. Difference in cell size results in a construction problem-it's hard to neatly connect sections of small cells to sections of large cells-that worsens as the difference increases. To fill in gaps between the sections when building a hive, bees rely on cells that have more or fewer than six sides. A student studying beehive structure consults data on three species, concluding that $\qquad$

Which choice most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the student's conclusion?
A) cells for worker eggs are probably closer in size to cells for drone eggs in the hives of the western honeybee than in the hives of the dwarf honeybee and the black dwarf honeybee.
B) both the western honeybee and the black dwarf honeybee probably reserve eight-sided cells for drone eggs, while the dwarf honeybee likely deposits drone eggs in seven-sided cells.
C) the western honeybee probably relies on many more geometrical shapes when constructing cells than either the dwarf honeybee or the black dwarf honeybee does.
D) the percentage of hexagonal cells is probably slightly lower in the hives of the western honeybee than in the hives of the dwarf honeybee and the black dwarf honeybee.

ALSOL is a microcredit program in Mexico that makes small loans to female entrepreneurs who lack the collateral and credit history to secure financing from conventional banks. Borrowers use their business proceeds to repay loans in equal weekly installments and incur no penalty for missed payments other than lack of access to larger loans. Economists Gustavo Barboza and Sandra Trejos analyzed ALSOL data and found that rural borrowers, who mostly make and sell handicrafts, miss payments more often than urban borrowers do, partly because they sell their goods less frequently than they could. Barboza and Trejos claim that this behavior reflects strategic decisions that enable rural women to increase their profits per unit sold.

Which finding, if true, would most directly support Barboza and Trejos's claim?
A) Many marketplaces require entrepreneurs to pay marketplace operators a fixed percentage of each day's proceeds in exchange for permission to sell goods there.
B) Rural entrepreneurs can typically sell their goods for higher prices in cities than in their home areas, but the number of people selling competing goods tends to be higher in cities.
C) Due to the lower costs they incur, rural entrepreneurs tend to require smaller initial loans than urban entrepreneurs do.
D) The cost to rural entrepreneurs to bring their goods to towns with marketplaces is high but largely independent of the number of goods they bring.
