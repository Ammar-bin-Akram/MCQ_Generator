- It connects Folkestone, England, to Coquelles, France.
- It is about 31 miles long.

The student wants to compare the lengths of the two rail tunnels. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?
A) Some of the world's rail tunnels, including one tunnel that extends from Folkestone, England, to Coquelles, France, are longer than 30 miles.
B) The Seikan Tunnel is roughly 33 miles long, while the slightly shorter Channel Tunnel is about 31 miles long.
C) The Seikan Tunnel, which is roughly 33 miles long, connects the Japanese islands of Honshu and Hokkaido.

- The fossil illustrates an early stage in the evolution of pinnipeds from their land-dwelling ancestors.
The student wants to emphasize the fossil's significance. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?
A) Canadian paleobiologist Natalia Rybczynski's fossil has the skull and teeth of a seal, which, like sea lions and walruses, is a pinniped.
B) Pinnipeds are descended from four-legged, land-dwelling carnivores; a fossil that resembles both was recently found.
C) Having four legs but the skull and teeth of a seal, the rare fossil illustrates an early stage in the evolution of pinnipeds from their land-dwelling ancestors.
