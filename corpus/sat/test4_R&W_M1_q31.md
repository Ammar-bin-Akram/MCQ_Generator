## 31

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:

- In 1999, astronomer Todd Henry studied the differences in surface temperature between the Sun and nearby stars.
- His team mapped all stars within 10 parsecs (approximately 200 trillion miles) of the Sun.
- The surface temperature of the Sun is around $9,800^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, which classifies it as a G star.
- 327 of the 357 stars in the study were classified as K or M stars, with surface temperatures under $8,900^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ (cooler than the Sun).
- 11 of the 357 stars in the study were classified as A or F stars, with surface temperatures greater than $10,300^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ (hotter than the Sun).

The student wants to emphasize how hot the Sun is relative to nearby stars. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?
A) At around $9,800^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, which classifies it as a G star, the Sun is hotter than most but not all of the stars within 10 parsecs of it.
B) Astronomer Todd Henry determined that the Sun, at around $9,800^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, is a G star, and several other stars within a 10 -parsec range are A or F stars.
C) Of the 357 stars within ten parsecs of the Sun, 327 are classified as K or M stars, with surface temperatures under $8,900^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$.
D) While most of the stars within 10 parsecs of the Sun are classified as K, M, A, or F stars, the Sun is classified as a G star due to its surface temperature of $9,800^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:

- The Atlantic Monthly magazine was first published in 1857.
- The magazine focused on politics, art, and literature.
- In 2019, historian Cathryn Halverson published the book Faraway Women and the "Atlantic Monthly."
- Its subject is female authors whose autobiographies appeared in the magazine in the early 1900s.
- One of the authors discussed is Juanita Harrison.

The student wants to introduce Cathryn Halverson's book to an audience already familiar with the Atlantic Monthly. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?
A) Cathryn Halverson's Faraway Women and the "Atlantic Monthly" discusses female authors whose autobiographies appeared in the magazine in the early 1900s.
B) A magazine called the Atlantic Monthly, referred to in Cathryn Halverson's book title, was first published in 1857.
C) Faraway Women and the "Atlantic Monthly" features contributors to the Atlantic Monthly, first published in 1857 as a magazine focusing on politics, art, and literature.
D) An author discussed by Cathryn Halverson is Juanita Harrison, whose autobiography appeared in the Atlantic Monthly in the early 1900s.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:

- The magnificent frigatebird (fregata magnificens) is a species of seabird that feeds mainly on fish, tuna, squid, and other small sea animals.
- It is unusual among seabirds in that it doesn't dive into the water for prey.
- One way it acquires food is by using its hook-tipped bill to snatch prey from the surface of the water.
- Another way it acquires food is by taking it from weaker birds by force.
- This behavior is known as kleptoparasitism.

The student wants to emphasize a similarity between the two ways a magnificent frigatebird acquires food. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?
A) A magnificent frigatebird never dives into the water, instead using its hook-tipped bill to snatch prey from the surface.
B) Neither of a magnificent frigatebird's two ways of acquiring food requires the bird to dive into the water.
C) Of the magnificent frigatebird's two ways of acquiring food, only one is known as kleptoparasitism.
D) In addition to snatching prey from the water with its hook-tipped bill, a magnificent frigatebird takes food from other birds by force.
