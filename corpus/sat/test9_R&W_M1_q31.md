While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:

- Physicist Muluneh Abebe was working on a garment suited for both warm and cold conditions.
- He analyzed the emissivity, or ability to emit heat, of the materials he planned to use.
- Abebe found that reflective metal fibers emitted almost no heat and had an emissivity of 0.02 .
- He found that silicon carbide fibers absorbed large amounts of heat and had an emissivity of 0.74 .
- The amount of heat a material absorbs is equal to the amount of heat it emits.

The student wants to contrast the emissivity of reflective metal fibers with that of silicon carbide fibers. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?
A) The ability of reflective metal fibers and silicon carbide fibers to emit heat was determined by an analysis of each material's emissivity.
B) The amount of heat a material absorbs is equal to the amount it emits, as evidenced in Abebe's analyses.
C) Though the reflective metal fibers and silicon carbide fibers had different rates of emissivity, Abebe planned to use both in a garment.
D) Whereas the reflective metal fibers had an emissivity of just 0.02 , the silicon carbide fibers absorbed large amounts of heat, resulting in an emissivity of 0.74 .

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:

- In 2020, theater students at Radford and Virginia Tech chose an interactive, online format to present a play about woman suffrage activists.
- Their "Women and the Vote" website featured an interactive digital drawing of a Victorian-style house.
- Audiences were asked to focus on a room of their choice and select from that room an artifact related to the suffrage movement.
- One click took them to video clips, songs, artwork, and texts associated with the artifact.
- The play was popular with audiences because the format allowed them to control the experience.

The student wants to explain an advantage of the "Women and the Vote" format. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?
A) "Women and the Vote" featured a drawing of a Victorian-style house with several rooms, each containing suffrage artifacts.
B) To access video clips, songs, artwork, and texts, audiences had to first click on an artifact.
C) The "Women and the Vote" format appealed to audiences because it allowed them to control the experience.
D) Using an interactive format, theater students at Radford and Virginia Tech created "Women and the Vote," a play about woman suffrage activists.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:

- Ducklings expend up to $62.8 \%$ less energy when swimming in a line behind their mother than when swimming alone.
- The physics behind this energy savings hasn't always been well understood.
- Naval architect Zhiming Yuan used computer simulations to study the effect of the mother duck's wake.
- The study revealed that ducklings are pushed in a forward direction by the wake's waves.
- Yuan determined this push reduces the effect of wave drag on the ducklings by $158 \%$.

The student wants to present the study and its methodology. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?
A) A study revealed that ducklings, which expend up to $62.8 \%$ less energy when swimming in a line behind their mother, also experience $158 \%$ less drag.
B) Seeking to understand how ducklings swimming in a line behind their mother save energy, Zhiming Yuan used computer simulations to study the effect of the mother duck's wake.
C) Zhiming Yuan studied the physics behind the fact that by being pushed in a forward direction by waves, ducklings save energy.
D) Naval architect Zhiming Yuan discovered that ducklings are pushed in a forward direction by the waves of their mother's wake, reducing the effect of drag by $158 \%$.
