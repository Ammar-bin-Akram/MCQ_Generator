Researchers hypothesized that a decline in the population of dusky sharks near the mid-Atlantic coast of North America led to a decline in the population of eastern oysters in the region. Dusky sharks do not typically consume eastern oysters but do consume cownose rays, which are the main predators of the oysters.
Which finding, if true, would most directly support the researchers' hypothesis?
A) Declines in the regional abundance of dusky sharks' prey other than cownose rays are associated with regional declines in dusky shark abundance.
B) Eastern oyster abundance tends to be greater in areas with both dusky sharks and cownose rays than in areas with only dusky sharks.
C) Consumption of eastern oysters by cownose rays in the region substantially increased before the regional decline in dusky shark abundance began.
D) Cownose rays have increased in regional abundance as dusky sharks have decreased in regional abundance.

In the mountains of Brazil, Barbacenia tomentosa and Barbacenia macrantha-two plants in the Velloziaceae family-establish themselves on soilless, nutrient-poor patches of quartzite rock. Plant ecologists Anna Abrahão and Patricia de Britto Costa used microscopic analysis to determine that the roots of B. tomentosa and B. macrantha, which grow directly into the quartzite, have clusters of fine hairs near the root tip; further analysis indicated that these hairs secrete both malic and citric acids. The researchers hypothesize that the plants depend on dissolving underlying rock with these acids, as the process not only creates channels for continued growth but also releases phosphates that provide the vital nutrient phosphorus.

Which finding, if true, would most directly support the researchers' hypothesis?
A) Other species in the Velloziaceae family are found in terrains with more soil but have root structures similar to those of B. tomentosa and B. macrantha.
B) Though B. tomentosa and B. macrantha both secrete citric and malic acids, each species produces the acids in different proportions.
C) The roots of B. tomentosa and B. macrantha carve new entry points into rocks even when cracks in the surface are readily available.
D) B. tomentosa and B. macrantha thrive even when transferred to the surfaces of rocks that do not contain phosphates.
