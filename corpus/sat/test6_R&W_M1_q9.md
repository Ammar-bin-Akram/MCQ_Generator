## Text 1

In 1954 George Balanchine choreographed a production of The Nutcracker, a ballet by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. It has since become a tradition for hundreds of dance companies in North America to stage The Nutcracker each year. But the show is stuck in the past, with an old-fashioned story and references, so it should no longer be produced. Ballet needs to create new traditions if it wants to stay relevant to contemporary audiences.

## Text 2

The Nutcracker is outdated, but it should be kept because it's a holiday favorite and provides substantial income for some dance companies. Although it can be behind the times, there are creative ways to update the show. For example, Debbie Allen successfully modernized the story. Her show Hot Chocolate Nutcracker combines ballet, tap, hip-hop, and other styles, and it has been gaining in popularity since it opened in 2009.
Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1?
A) By questioning the idea that the story of The Nutcracker is stuck in the past and by rejecting the suggestion that contemporary audiences would enjoy an updated version
B) By agreeing that contemporary audiences have largely stopped going to see performances of The Nutcracker because it's so old-fashioned
C) By pointing out that most dance companies could increase their incomes by offering modernized versions of The Nutcracker
D) By suggesting that dance companies should consider offering revised versions of The Nutcracker instead of completely rejecting the show

To understand how Paleolithic artists navigated dark caves, archaeologist $\mathrm{M}^{\mathrm{a}}$ Ángeles Medina-Alcaide and her team tested different lighting methods in a cave in Spain using replicas of artifacts found in European caves with art. They used three different Paleolithic light sources-torches, animal-fat lamps, and fireplaces-determining that each likely had a specific purpose. For instance, the team learned that the animal-fat lamps were less useful than torches while walking because the lamps didn't illuminate the cave floor.

Which choice best states the main idea of the text?
A) Medina-Alcaide and her team's study demonstrated that fireplaces were essential to the creators of Paleolithic cave art.
B) Medina-Alcaide and her team discovered that Paleolithic cave artists in Spain used animal-fat lamps more often than they used torches.
C) Medina-Alcaide and her team were reluctant to draw many conclusions from their study because of the difficulty they had replicating light sources based on known artifacts.
D) Medina-Alcaide and her team tested Paleolithic light sources and learned some details about how Paleolithic artists traveled within dark caves.

External shopping cues are a type of marketing that uses obvious messaging-a display featuring a new product, for example, or a "buy one, get one free" offer-to entice consumers to make spontaneous purchases. In a study, data scientist Sam K. Hui and colleagues found that this effect can also be achieved with a less obvious cue: rearranging a store's layout. The researchers explain that trying to find items in new locations causes shoppers to move through more of the store, exposing them to more products and increasing the likelihood that they'll buy an item they hadn't planned on purchasing.

Which response from a survey given to shoppers who made a purchase at a retail store best supports the researchers' explanation?
A) "I needed to buy some cleaning supplies, but they weren't in their regular place. While I was looking for them, I saw this interesting notebook and decided to buy it, too."
B) "I didn't buy everything on my shopping list today. I couldn't find a couple of the items in the store, even though I looked all over for them."
C) "The store sent me a coupon for a new brand of soup, so I came here to find out what kinds of soup that brand offers. I decided to buy a few cans because I had the coupon."
D) "This store is larger than one that's closer to where I live, and it carries more products. I came here to buy some things that the other store doesn't always have."

The 2021 exhibition This Is the Day at Arkansas's Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art featured works dealing with expressions of faith and spirituality in the Black community. The museum's 2022 exhibition The Dirty South, meanwhile, focused on Black culture in the American South from 1920 to 2020, with a particular focus on the intersections between visual arts and music. Together, these exhibitions don't merely highlight the diversity of the Black experience in the US; they also showcase the diverse media through which artists have depicted and engaged with that experience.
Which statement about the exhibitions, if true, would most directly support the underlined claim?
A) Between them, This Is the Day and The Dirty South included drawings, paintings, photographs, sculptures, textiles, videos, costumes, and music.
B) This Is the Day included works by fewer than two dozen artists, whereas The Dirty South included works by more than 80 artists.
C) This Is the Day exclusively included works in the permanent collection of the museum, whereas The Dirty South included works from multiple sources outside the museum.
D) Between them, This Is the Day and The Dirty South included works depicting more than 300 years of Black experience in the United States.

To investigate potential cognitive benefits of taking leave from work, psychologist Jan Packer and colleagues conducted a six-month study of Australian university staff members who took no leave from work during the study, took 2-4 days of leave, or took 1-5 weeks of leave. Tests of attentiveness were administered to participants three times during the study: at random for the no-leave staff, and for the rest, one week before their leave, one week following their return to work, and one week after the second test administration. After analyzing the results, the researchers concluded that longer leave times might not confer a greater cognitive benefit than shorter leave times do.

Which choice best describes data from the graph that support the researchers' conclusion?
A) In the second test administration, participants who took 2-4 days of leave had higher average attentiveness scores than did those who took no leave, but in the third test administration, those who took no leave had higher average scores than those who took 1-5 weeks of leave.
B) In the first test administration, participants who took 2-4 days of leave had lower average attentiveness scores than did those who took 1-5 weeks of leave and those who took no leave.
C) In both the second and third test administrations, participants who took 2-4 days of leave had higher average attentiveness scores than did participants who took 1-5 weeks of leave.
D) In the second and third test administrations, participants who took 2-4 days of leave had higher average attentiveness scores than did those who took no leave.

It may seem that the optimal strategy for an animal pursuing prey or escaping predators is to move at maximal speed, but the energy expense of exploiting full speed capacity can disfavor such a strategy even in escape contexts, as evidenced by the fact that

Which choice most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the text?
A) most lizard species use about the same percentage of their maximal speed when escaping predation as they do when pursuing prey.
B) multiple lizard species move at an average of less than $90 \%$ of their maximal speed while escaping predation.
C) more lizard species use, on average, $90 \%-100 \%$ of their maximal speed while escaping predation than use any other percentage of their maximal speed.
D) at least 4 lizard species use, on average, less than $100 \%$ of their maximal speed while pursuing prey.

Under normal atmospheric pressure at Earth's surface, water molecules form a tetrahedral network stabilized by hydrogen bonds between adjacent molecules. Extreme high pressure, such as can be found in deep ocean waters, destabilizes these bonds and compresses water's structure, allowing water molecules within organisms to permeate proteins and impede crucial biological functions; yet deep-sea organisms known as piezophiles have adapted to extreme pressure. Studies have found a positive correlation between the depths that various piezophiles inhabit and concentrations of a compound called trimethylamine N -oxide (TMAO) in their muscle tissues, which has led a team of researchers to hypothesize that TMAO reduces water's compressibility.
Which finding, if true, would most directly support the researchers' hypothesis?
A) Water molecules are found to be impervious to TMAO even when the water molecules' tetrahedral configuration has been distorted by high pressure.
B) Examination of TMAO's molecular structure shows that TMAO molecules retain their shape even as pressure increases.
C) A positive correlation is found between concentrations of TMAO and the rate at which water's molecular structure compresses as pressure increases.
D) Analysis of water's molecular structure under high pressure reveals that hydrogen bonds are more stable when TMAO is present than when it is not.

The Cretaceous pterosaur Tupandactylus navigans is known for having an anomalously oversized head crest. Until an almost complete fossil skeleton was found in Brazil, paleontologists had been able to study only skull specimens from T. navigans, though it was presumed that, like other pterosaurs, the species's primary form of locomotion was powered flight. Examining the fuller skeleton in 2016, Victor Beccari and his team determined that T. navigans had long hind legs, short wings, and an unusually long neck-characteristics that, combined with the creature's large-crested head, would have made sustained flight difficult and walking upright relatively comfortable. Based on these findings the team suggests that T. navigans likely $\qquad$
Which choice most logically completes the text?
A) flew for longer distances than did other pterosaur species that had oversized head crests.
B) had longer wings than other pterosaur species considered to have been comfortable walking.
C) had a smaller head than researchers expected based on the earlier T. navigans skull specimens.
D) flew for shorter distances and spent more time walking than researchers previously thought.
