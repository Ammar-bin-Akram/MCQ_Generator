American abstract artist Richard $\qquad$ his installations to make passersby keenly aware of how one's movements are affected by the physical features of one's environment, assembles large-scale steel plates into sculptures that dominate the outdoor spaces they occupy.

C) Serra, intending
D) Serra intends

In 1949, Frank Zamboni developed an ice rink resurfacing machine. As Zamboni's machine moved along the rink's surface, it first scraped off the top layer of ice. $\qquad$ it sprayed water into the deep grooves left behind by customers' skates. Lastly, it smoothed over the newly formed ice.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?
A) For example,
B) Next,
C) Similarly,
D) In contrast,

In 2014, Nestor Gomez won his first-ever storytelling competition, relating a tale about his life as a Guatemalan immigrant living in Chicago. $\qquad$ in 2017, Gomez created the show 80 Minutes Around the World as a platform for others to share stories about their immigration experiences.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?
A) Instead,
B) For example,
C) Later,
D) In other words,

To guarantee the validity of experimental results, scientists rely on precise, unchanging standards of measurement. $\qquad$ metrologists (scientists who study measurement) developed the SI, or International System of Units. The SI's units of measurement are based on unchanging values in nature, such as the mass of an electron or the speed of light.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?
A) In contrast,
B) Regardless,
C) In addition,
D) For this reason,

In retrospect, one of the lessons of the 2003 Human Genome Project is that a gene is affected by many factors, not the least of which is its interactions with the protein products of other genes. $\qquad$ rather than just focusing on the human genome, efforts to better understand gene mutations related to disease have begun to consider the human proteome, the complete set of proteins expressed by human genes.

Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?
A) In other words,
B) That said,
C) For example,
D) Accordingly,

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:

- Iranian scholar Abu Rayhan al-Biruni studied Earth's physical features.
- He theorized that a large landmass existed west of Europe and east of Asia.
- Al-Biruni published his landmass theory in 1037 CE.

The student wants to specify when al-Biruni published his landmass theory. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?
A) In 1037 CE, al-Biruni published his theory that a large landmass existed west of Europe and east of Asia.
B) Al-Biruni, who studied Earth's physical features, published a theory about a large landmass.
C) Al-Biruni was an Iranian scholar who studied Earth's physical features.
D) An Iranian scholar who studied Earth's physical features, al-Biruni theorized that a large landmass existed west of Europe and east of Asia.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:

- In astronomy, the mass of stars can be described in units called solar masses.
- One solar mass is roughly equal to the mass of the Sun.
- The mass of the star Proxima Centauri is 0.122 solar masses.
- The mass of the star Sirius A is 2.063 solar masses.

The student wants to emphasize the mass of Sirius A. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?
A) The mass of stars, like Proxima Centauri, can be described in units called solar masses.
B) In astronomy, the mass of stars can be described in units called solar masses, and one solar mass is roughly equal to the mass of the Sun.
C) The Sun is more massive than Proxima Centauri, which has a mass of 0.122 solar masses.
D) With a mass of 2.063 solar masses, Sirius A is more massive than the Sun.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:

- A lever is a simple machine consisting of a rigid beam and a fulcrum.
- The fulcrum is the point about which the beam pivots.
- The input force (effort) is the force applied to the lever.
- The output force (load) is the force that the lever exerts on another object.
- In first-class levers, the fulcrum is located between the effort and the load.
- In second-class levers, the load is located between the effort and the fulcrum.

The student wants to contrast first-class levers and second-class levers. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?
A) In levers, the effort is the force applied to the lever; the load, in contrast, is the force that the lever exerts on another object.
B) In first-class and second-class levers, the fulcrum and the load are in different locations.
C) First-class levers are simple machines consisting of a rigid beam and a fulcrum, but then again, the same is true of second-class levers.
D) In first-class levers, the fulcrum is located between the effort and the load, but in second-class levers, the load is located between the effort and the fulcrum.

While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:

- Earthquakes start at a point called a "focus" and spread out from there as seismic waves.
- The two types of seismic waves that travel beneath Earth's surface are primary waves ( P waves) and secondary waves ( S waves).
- P waves travel more quickly beneath Earth's surface than do S waves.
- P waves compress and expand the ground, causing it to move backward and forward.
- S waves cause the ground to move from side to side.

The student wants to emphasize a similarity between P waves and S waves. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?
A) P waves and S waves both travel beneath Earth's surface, causing the ground to move.
B) P waves travel away from an earthquake's starting point at a higher rate of speed than do S waves.
C) Spreading out from the focus of an earthquake, P waves move the ground backward and forward.
D) Although P waves and S waves start at the same point, they behave very differently.
