      "C": "Kinetic Energy",
      "D": "Displacement"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "According to Newton's second law in terms of momentum, F = Δp/Δt. If the net force F is constant, then the rate of change of momentum (Δp/Δt) must also be constant. While a constant net force implies constant acceleration and therefore a constant *change* in velocity, the *rate of change* of velocity is constant, not velocity itself. Kinetic energy changes at a non-constant rate because it depends on the square of the velocity. Displacement also changes at a non-constant rate under constant acceleration.",

    "question": "A 2 kg ball is traveling at a velocity of 5 m/s. A constant force is applied to the ball, bringing it to rest in 0.5 seconds. What is the magnitude of the force applied to the ball?",

      "A": "10 N",
      "B": "20 N",
      "C": "25 N",
      "D": "5 N"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "We can use the impulse-momentum theorem, which states that the impulse (force multiplied by time) is equal to the change in momentum. The initial momentum of the ball is (2 kg)(5 m/s) = 10 kg m/s. The final momentum is 0 kg m/s. The change in momentum is 0 - 10 = -10 kg m/s. Therefore, F * t = -10 kg m/s. Given t = 0.5 s, we have F * 0.5 = -10, so F = -10 / 0.5 = -20 N. The magnitude of the force is 20 N. The negative sign indicates that the force is acting in the opposite direction to the initial velocity.",
