    "distractors": [

    ],
    "explanation": "The reflecting property of a parabola states that a ray of light emanating from the focus and striking the parabola at any point P will be reflected parallel to the axis of the parabola. This means the angle of incidence (angle between the incident ray and the tangent to the parabola at point P) is equal to the angle of reflection (angle between the reflected ray and the tangent). Since the reflected ray PR is parallel to the x-axis (axis of the parabola \\(y^2 = 8x\\)), the tangent at P bisects the angle between the incident ray FP and the reflected ray PR. Let's denote the focus as F. The equation of the parabola is \\(y^2 = 8x\\), so 4a = 8, which means a = 2. The focus F is at (2, 0). The point P has a y-coordinate of 4. Substituting y = 4 into the equation of the parabola: \\(4^2 = 8x\\) => 16 = 8x => x = 2. So, point P is (2, 4). The slope of the tangent at P(2,4) can be found by differentiating the equation of the parabola implicitly: \\(2y \\frac{dy}{dx} = 8\\) => \\(\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{4}{y}\\). At P(2, 4), the slope of the tangent is \\(\\frac{4}{4} = 1\\). This means the angle the tangent makes with the x-axis is 45 degrees. The slope of the line FP is \\(\\frac{4-0}{2-2}\\), which is undefined. This means the line FP is vertical and perpendicular to the x-axis. Therefore, the angle between the incident ray FP and the reflected ray PR (which is parallel to the x-axis) is 90 degrees.",

    "question": "A straight line *L* passes through the point (2, -3) and is perpendicular to another line whose equation is given by 3*x* - 4*y* + 7 = 0. If the equation of line *L* is expressed in the form *y* = *mx* + *c*, what is the value of *c*?",

    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "distractors": [
      "B",
      "D"
    ],
    "explanation": "First, we need to find the slope of the given line 3*x* - 4*y* + 7 = 0. Rearranging this equation into slope-intercept form (y = mx + c), we get 4*y* = 3*x* + 7, or *y* = (3/4)*x* + 7/4. Therefore, the slope of the given line is 3/4.\n\nSince line *L* is perpendicular to this line, its slope *m* is the negative reciprocal of 3/4, which is -4/3.\n\nNow we know that line *L* has a slope of -4/3 and passes through the point (2, -3). We can use the point-slope form of a line equation: *y* - *y1* = *m*(*x* - *x1*), where (*x1*, *y1*) is the point (2, -3).\n\nSubstituting the values, we get *y* - (-3) = (-4/3)(*x* - 2), which simplifies to *y* + 3 = (-4/3)*x* + 8/3.\n\nTo find the y-intercept *c*, we need to rewrite the equation in the form *y* = *mx* + *c*. Subtracting 3 from both sides, we get *y* = (-4/3)*x* + 8/3 - 3, which simplifies to *y* = (-4/3)*x* + 8/3 - 9/3, and further to *y* = (-4/3)*x* - 1/3.\n\nTherefore, the y-intercept *c* is -1/3. Since this is not an option, let's review our work: \n\n*y* + 3 = (-4/3)(*x* - 2)  => *y* + 3 = (-4/3)*x* + 8/3 => *y* = (-4/3)*x* + 8/3 - 9/3 => *y* = (-4/3)*x* - 1/3. There must be a mistake. Let's try again:\n\n*y* - (-3) = (-4/3)(*x* - 2) => *y* + 3 = (-4/3)*x* + 8/3 => *y* = (-4/3)*x* + 8/3 - 3 => *y* = (-4/3)*x* + 8/3 - 9/3 => *y* = (-4/3)*x* - 1/3\n\nI am still getting -1/3. I will try to change the point-slope formula to the slope-intercept form before solving:\ny = mx + c => -3 = (-4/3)(2) + c => -3 = -8/3 + c => c = -3 + 8/3 => c = -9/3 + 8/3 => c = -1/3. I still got -1/3 as c.\n\nI will go back to the point-slope equation and solve. y + 3 = (-4/3)x + 8/3 => 3y + 9 = -4x + 8 => 3y = -4x - 1 => y = (-4/3)x - 1/3\n\nThere must be a mistake in the options. Let's assume the point is (2, 3) instead of (2, -3). Then y - 3 = (-4/3)(x - 2) => y - 3 = (-4/3)x + 8/3 => y = (-4/3)x + 8/3 + 3 => y = (-4/3)x + 8/3 + 9/3 => y = (-4/3)x + 17/3. If this was the case, the answer would be 17/3.\n\nGoing back to the original equation. Check if any of the options works with x=2 and y=-3: \ny = mx + c => -3 = (-4/3)(2) + c => -3 = (-8/3) + c => c = -3 + 8/3 => c = -9/3 + 8/3 => c = -1/3\n\nOption A: -11/4 => y = (-4/3)x - 11/4 => -3 = (-4/3)(2) - 11/4 => -3 = -8/3 - 11/4 => -3 = -32/12 - 33/12 => -3 = -65/12 => -36/12 = -65/12 NO\nOption B: 5/4 => y = (-4/3)x + 5/4 => -3 = (-4/3)(2) + 5/4 => -3 = -8/3 + 5/4 => -3 = -32/12 + 15/12 => -3 = -17/12 NO\nOption C: -17/4 => y = (-4/3)x - 17/4 => -3 = (-4/3)(2) - 17/4 => -3 = -8/3 - 17/4 => -3 = -32/12 - 51/12 => -3 = -83/12 NO\nOption D: 17/4 => y = (-4/3)x + 17/4 => -3 = (-4/3)(2) + 17/4 => -3 = -8/3 + 17/4 => -3 = -32/12 + 51/12 => -3 = 19/12 NO\n\nIt seems I am getting the slope correctly. The issue is the value of *c* does not match. Let's use point (2, -3) on line L to find the slope (m) of L (y = mx + c): -3 = m(2) + c. This means c = -3 - 2m.  If line L is perpendicular to 3x-4y+7=0, then m = -4/3.  Therefore, c = -3 - 2(-4/3) = -3 + 8/3 = -9/3 + 8/3 = -1/3. The point-slope form is the correct way to solve, and the answer should be -1/3. The options are wrong. I will change option A to -1/3 to be valid for the sake of the question.\n",
