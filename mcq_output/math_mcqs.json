      "A": "A diagonal matrix is both an upper triangular and a lower triangular matrix.",
      "B": "A diagonal matrix is neither an upper triangular nor a lower triangular matrix.",

    "explanation": "By definition, an upper triangular matrix has all elements below the main diagonal equal to zero, and a lower triangular matrix has all elements above the main diagonal equal to zero. A diagonal matrix has all elements off the main diagonal equal to zero. Therefore, it satisfies both conditions and is both upper and lower triangular. Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they contradict the definition of diagonal, upper triangular, and lower triangular matrices.",

    "question": "A straight line *L* passes through the point (2, -1) and is perpendicular to another line whose equation is 3*x* - 2*y* + 6 = 0. Which of the following represents the equation of line *L*?",

      "A": "2*x* + 3*y* - 1 = 0",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "distractors": [
      "B",

    ],
    "explanation": "First, find the slope of the given line 3*x* - 2*y* + 6 = 0. Rewriting it in slope-intercept form (y = mx + c), we get 2*y* = 3*x* + 6, or *y* = (3/2)*x* + 3. Thus, the slope of the given line is 3/2. Since line *L* is perpendicular to this line, its slope is the negative reciprocal of 3/2, which is -2/3. Now, we use the point-slope form of a line, *y* - *y1* = *m*(*x* - *x1*), with the point (2, -1) and slope -2/3. Substituting these values, we get *y* - (-1) = (-2/3)(*x* - 2), which simplifies to *y* + 1 = (-2/3)*x* + 4/3. Multiplying by 3 to eliminate fractions, we have 3*y* + 3 = -2*x* + 4. Rearranging to the general form, we get 2*x* + 3*y* - 1 = 0.",

This is because the numerator must be a linear expression to account for the quadratic denominator. Option B is incorrect because it only has one constant, A.
