    "question": "Which of the following is the correct form of partial fractions for the expression $\\frac{2}{x^2 - 1}$?",
    "options": {
      "A": "$\\frac{A}{x-1} + \\frac{B}{x+1}$",
      "B": "$\\frac{A}{x^2} + \\frac{B}{-1}$",
      "C": "$\\frac{A}{x} + \\frac{B}{x}$",
      "D": "$\\frac{A}{x^2 - 1}$"
    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The denominator $x^2 - 1$ can be factored into $(x-1)(x+1)$. Since each factor is linear and non-repeated, the correct form of the partial fraction decomposition is $\\frac{A}{x-1} + \\frac{B}{x+1}$, where A and B are constants to be determined.",
