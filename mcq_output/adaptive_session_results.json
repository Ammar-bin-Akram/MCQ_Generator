      "explanation": "The resistance R of a wire is given by R = ρL/A, where ρ is the resistivity of the material, L is the length, and A is the cross-sectional area. If the length is doubled (L' = 2L) and the radius is doubled (r' = 2r), the new cross-sectional area becomes A' = π(r')^2 = π(2r)^2 = 4πr^2 = 4A. Therefore, the new resistance R' is given by R' = ρL'/A' = ρ(2L)/(4A) = (1/2)ρL/(2A) = (1/2) * (1/2) * ρL/A = (1/4)R. Therefore, the new resistance is R/4.",
