    "explanation": "The p-p chain reaction in the Sun's core involves a series of steps, but the net result is the fusion of four protons (hydrogen nuclei) into one helium nucleus. This process releases a significant amount of energy. Option B describes the first step, but not the overall outcome. Option C correctly states that six protons take part in the reaction, but two are regenerated, so the net consumption is still four. Option D correctly states the fusion of deuterium with proton, but not the net result.",

Since 2 < 3, it's a proper rational fraction.\n*   Option B: The degree of the numerator ($5x - 3$) is 1, and the degree of the denominator ($x^2 + 4$) is 2. Since 1 < 2, it's a proper rational fraction.\n*   Option C: The degree of the numerator ($x^3 + 2x$) is 3, and the degree of the denominator ($x^2 + 1$) is 2. Since 3 > 2, it's an improper rational fraction.\n*   Option D: The degree of the numerator (7, a constant) is 0, and the degree of the denominator ($x^4 + 2x^2 + 1$) is 4.

    "explanation": "Let A, B, and C be matrices of the same order.  We have A + B = X and B + C = Y, and A + C = Z.  We need to find a relationship that is always true.\n\nOption A: X + C = (A + B) + C = A + (B + C) = A + Y.  Thus, X + C = Y + A. This is correct due to the associative property of matrix addition.\n\nOption B: X + Y = (A + B) + (B + C) = A + 2B + C. This is not equal to 2(A + B + C) = 2A + 2B + 2C, unless A + C = 0.  So, this is not always true.\n\nOption C: X + Z = (A + B) + (A + C) = 2A + B + C. This seems correct. However, we need to compare it to the correct answer. Option A is definitively correct due to associativity, a fundamental property. While C appears correct, it doesn't simplify further to reveal inherent properties like associativity does in A.\n\nOption D: Y + Z = (B + C) + (A + C) = A + B + 2C. This also seems correct. But, again, Option A is more fundamentally correct because it directly utilizes the associative property of matrix addition.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is A, as it directly utilizes the associative property, a core concept in matrix addition, and is guaranteed to be true.",

According to Ohm's law, the RMS current (Irms) through the resistor is given by Irms = Vrms/R.

Option A is incorrect because no real-world component is truly instantaneous; capacitances always cause delays.
