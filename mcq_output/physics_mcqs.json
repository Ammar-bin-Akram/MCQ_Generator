    },
    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "In a half-wave rectifier, the diode is reverse biased during the negative half-cycle of the input AC voltage. When reverse biased, the diode offers a very high resistance, effectively blocking the current flow. Consequently, the voltage drop across the load resistor (the output voltage) is almost zero during this period. Therefore, the correct answer is 'Diode is reverse biased, output voltage is approximately zero.'",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "explanation": "A photodiode is designed to detect light and is operated in reverse bias. When light strikes the p-n junction, photons generate electron-hole pairs. These generated carriers are swept across the junction by the reverse bias voltage, increasing the reverse current. Therefore, as the intensity of the incident light increases, the number of generated electron-hole pairs increases, leading to a corresponding increase in the reverse current. Option B is incorrect because the current increases with light intensity. Option C is incorrect because the current is dependent on the light intensity. Option D is incorrect because the photodiode is operated in reverse bias, not forward bias.",

    "question": "An AVO meter is being used to measure current in a circuit. The galvanometer within the AVO meter has an internal resistance of $R_g = 100 \\Omega$ and a full-scale deflection current of $I_g = 1 mA$. To extend the range of the ammeter to measure a maximum current of $I = 1 A$, a shunt resistance $R_s$ is connected in parallel with the galvanometer. If, due to a manufacturing defect, the actual value of the shunt resistance is 1% higher than the calculated value, what percentage error will occur in the measured current at full-scale deflection?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Approximately 0.01% underestimation",
      "B": "Approximately 1% underestimation",
      "C": "Approximately 1% overestimation",
      "D": "Approximately 0.01% overestimation"
    },
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "First, we calculate the required shunt resistance.  We know that $I_g R_g = (I - I_g)R_s$.  Since $I_g$ is much smaller than $I$, we can approximate $I - I_g \\approx I$.  Thus, $R_s = \\frac{I_g R_g}{I} = \\frac{(0.001 A)(100 \\Omega)}{1 A} = 0.1 \\Omega$.  If the shunt resistance is 1% higher, its actual value is $R_s' = 0.1(1 + 0.01) = 0.101 \\Omega$. Now, let's find the current $I'$ that will cause full-scale deflection with the incorrect shunt resistance.  We have $I_g R_g = (I' - I_g) R_s'$.  So, $I' = I_g + \\frac{I_g R_g}{R_s'} = 0.001 + \\frac{0.001(100)}{0.101} = 0.001 + 0.9901 = 0.9911 A$.  The difference between the intended current (1 A) and the actual current (0.9911 A) is $1 - 0.9911 = 0.0089 A$.  The percentage error is $\\frac{0.0089}{1} * 100 \\approx 0.89 %$. This is close to 1% and represents an underestimation because the measured current is less than the actual current the ammeter is designed to measure at full scale. Thus, it's approximately 1% underestimation.",

This high resistance allows for a more accurate measurement because small changes in temperature result in significant changes in resistance. This larger change in resistance translates to a more easily detectable voltage signal, improving the sensitivity and accuracy of the temperature measurement. Option A is incorrect because the resistance increases, not decreases, at low temperatures for NTC thermistors. Option C is not accurate.

The key phrase 'return to its original shape' indicates the property of elasticity. Elasticity is the ability of a solid material to return to its original shape after the deforming force is removed.
